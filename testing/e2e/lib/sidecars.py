"""Container sidecars for the E2E orchestrator.

Each class here implements ``lib.orchestrator.SidecarProtocol`` (``name``,
``port``, ``start()``, ``stop()``) so it can be dropped into
``GearTestEnv.sidecars``. The orchestrator starts sidecars before it renders
the config, so ``config_patch`` can read the mapped port.

Deliberately hand-rolled rather than using testcontainers-python: this suite's
requirements.txt is minimal and Snyk-pinned, and testcontainers-rs 0.27 (used
by the Rust plugin tests) ships no ryuk either, so the library would buy no
cleanup guarantee the repo already relies on. Orphans are handled by the label
reaper below.

        intermittent "connection reset by peer" / "expected to read 5 bytes,
        got 0 bytes at EOF" failures in the gear under test. Two reasons:

        * Run over `docker exec`, it talks to the container's Unix socket. The
          official Postgres entrypoint starts a *temporary* local-only server
          to run initdb and any init scripts, then shuts it down and starts the
          real one. During that window `pg_isready` succeeds while nothing is
          listening on TCP yet.
        * Even once TCP is up, the restart boundary can accept a connection and
          immediately drop it.

        So readiness here means: a real query, executed via `docker exec` against
        the container's OWN loopback (`-h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432`, i.e. the container's
        internal TCP listener, not the host-mapped port), succeeding
        `REQUIRED_CONSECUTIVE_OK` times in a row. `-h 127.0.0.1` forces psql onto
        TCP rather than the Unix socket, and the repetition is what makes the
        init->restart boundary observable instead of a coin flip. Host-side
        reachability through the mapped port is a separate concern, covered by
        `test_sidecar_contract.py`'s plain `socket.create_connection` probe.
