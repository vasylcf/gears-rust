/// Capability for gears that have a long-running background task.

/// # Shutdown Contract
///
/// The `stop` method receives a **deadline token** that implements two-phase shutdown:
///
/// 1. **Graceful stop request**: When `stop(deadline_token)` is called, the `deadline_token`
///    is *not* cancelled. This is the signal to begin graceful shutdown.
///
/// 2. **Hard-stop deadline**: After the runtime's `shutdown_deadline` expires (default 35s),
///    the `deadline_token` is cancelled. This signals that graceful shutdown time is over
///    and the gear should abort immediately.
///
/// ## Recommended Implementation Pattern
///
/// ```ignore
/// async fn stop(&self, deadline_token: CancellationToken) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
///     // 1. Request cooperative shutdown of child tasks
///     self.request_graceful_shutdown();
///
///     // 2. Wait for graceful completion OR hard-stop deadline
///     tokio::select! {
///         _ = self.wait_for_graceful_completion() => {
///             // Graceful shutdown succeeded
///         }
///         _ = deadline_token.cancelled() => {
///             // Deadline reached, force abort
///             self.force_abort();
///         }
///     }
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Important Notes
///
/// - The `deadline_token` passed to `stop()` is a **fresh token**, not the root cancellation
///   token that triggered the shutdown. This allows gears to implement real graceful shutdown.
/// - Gears should NOT assume the token is already cancelled when `stop()` is called.
/// - The `WithLifecycle` wrapper handles this contract automatically via its `stop_timeout`.
