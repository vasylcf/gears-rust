//! Reproduction of the single-statement traversal limitation.
//!
//! This module exists to keep the finding executable. It builds the hop the way
//! a gear would naturally write it — one scoped node query whose predicate
//! contains a subquery over the edge table — and demonstrates that the subquery
//! carries no tenant predicate.
//!
//! The outer query is scoped by the secure ORM. The inner one cannot be: the
//! only way to obtain a scope predicate as a reusable `Condition` is
//! `build_scope_condition`, which is `pub` inside the private module `cond`
//! (`libs/toolkit-db/src/secure/mod.rs:106`). A gear cannot name it.
//!
//! Because surrogate ids are allocated per tenant, `src_node_id = ANY($1)`
//! matches edges in every tenant that happens to have a node with that id, so
//! the walk follows foreign edges and reaches nodes that are not connected to
//! the seed in the caller's graph.
