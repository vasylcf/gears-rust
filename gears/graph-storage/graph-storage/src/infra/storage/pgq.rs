//! SQL/PGQ `GRAPH_TABLE` as a `FROM` source, built from typed input.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `sea_query` has no AST node for `GRAPH_TABLE`, so the obvious way to reach
//! SQL/PGQ from Rust is to fork `sea_query` and add one. That turns out to be
//! unnecessary. Three existing pieces compose into the construct:
//!
//! * [`TableRef::FunctionCall`] puts a function call in the `FROM` clause;
//! * `Func::Custom` renders the function's name **raw and unquoted**
//!   (`sea-query-1.0.2/src/backend/query_builder.rs:768`) — which matters,
//!   because `GRAPH_TABLE(...)` parses and `"GRAPH_TABLE"(...)` does not;
//! * `Expr::cust_with_values` renders arbitrary text while still **binding**
//!   its values, so the graph pattern carries parameters rather than literals.
//!
//! The pattern body is therefore the only free-form text in the statement, and
//! everything around it stays an ordinary `sea_query` select the secure ORM can
//! scope.
//!
//! # How the free-form text is made safe
//!
//! `Expr::cust_with_values` will render whatever string it is given, so a
//! builder that concatenated caller strings would have reintroduced raw SQL
//! with none of its guardrails. Nothing here takes a string:
//!
//! * every identifier that reaches the text — graph name, labels, pattern
//!   variables, property names, output column names — comes from a closed enum
//!   in this module, so the set of producible identifiers is finite and
//!   reviewable, and no request value can become one;
//! * every value is bound. [`Pattern::render`] appends to a `Vec<Value>` and
//!   emits `$n` by position; a value never reaches the text. Note that `$n` is
//!   a reference *into the values array*, and `sea_query` expands each
//!   occurrence into its own placeholder with its own copy of the value — so
//!   the tenant, written once and referenced on both endpoints, arrives on the
//!   wire twice;
//! * a whole frontier binds as **one** parameter (`= ANY($n::bigint[])`), so
//!   the statement text does not vary with the number of seeds — the plan is
//!   reused and there is no per-size statement to cache;
//! * the tenant is a constructor argument of [`Pattern`], not a predicate the
//!   caller may add or omit, and rendering always emits it. A pattern without a
//!   tenant predicate is unrepresentable.
//!
//! # How much of the tenant predicate is load-bearing
//!
//! Measured on the stand rather than reasoned about, because the answer is not
//! the obvious one. For a one-hop pattern seeded by id:
//!
//! | predicate | foreign tenant sees | own tenant sees |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | on the source endpoint only | 0 | 2 |
//! | on the target endpoint only | 0 | 2 |
//! | none | 2 | 2 |
//!
//! Either endpoint alone fences the walk, because composite element keys tie
//! both ends of an edge to one tenant: anchoring either end anchors the other.
//! What is *not* optional is having a predicate at all — with none, a caller
//! who names an id reads whichever tenant owns it, which is exactly the leak
//! `dev/FINDINGS.md (F10)` demonstrates.
//!
//! Rendering emits it on both endpoints anyway. The cost is one bound value and
//! no change to the plan, and it keeps the pattern correct if the schema ever
//! stops carrying `tenant_id` in the element keys — at which point the
//! redundancy stops being redundant. The stand tests cannot tell the two apart,
//! so the guard is a unit test on the emitted text.
//!
//! # What is still the caller's job
//!
//! Composite element keys mean an edge cannot reach another tenant's node, and
//! the mandatory tenant predicate means the pattern does not return other
//! tenants' rows. Neither covers a scope that is narrower than a tenant —
//! resource-id lists, group subtrees. Those are not expressible here and are
//! the outer query's responsibility; see the traversal backend, which treats
//! this pattern as a **candidate producer** and authorizes what it returns
//! through the secure ORM.
//!
//! `Expr::cust_with_values` is raw SQL, which gear code is not allowed to write
//! (`docs/arch/toolkit_unified_system/11_database_patterns.md`). On the
//! development stand that is a deliberate, contained exception so the approach
//! can be measured. The production home for this construct is inside
//! `toolkit-db`, which the platform CTE policy already exempts for exactly this
//! kind of dialect-specific assembly.
