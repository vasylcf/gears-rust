//! Per-tenant write counter.
//!
//! `GraphStats::graph_revision` is documented as a monotonic revision bumped
//! whenever stored state changes, and `DESIGN`'s bulk-ingest requirement says
//! the ingest path "bumps the tenant graph revision". Until this migration the
//! field returned the literal zero — a value a consumer could poll forever.
//!
//! The counter lives in its own table rather than being derived from
//! `max(updated_at)`, because a deletion lowers that maximum and would make the
//! revision go backwards. One row per tenant, created on first write, bumped
//! inside the same transaction as the write it describes — so a revision a
//! caller has observed always corresponds to committed data.
