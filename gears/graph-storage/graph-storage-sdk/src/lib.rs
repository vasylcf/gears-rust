//! Graph Storage SDK — the public, transport-agnostic contract of the gear.
//!
//! Consumers obtain the client from `ClientHub`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use graph_storage_sdk::GraphStorageClientV1;
//! let graph = hub.get::<dyn GraphStorageClientV1>()?;
//! ```
//!
//! This crate deliberately carries no serde, HTTP or database dependencies so
//! that consuming gears do not inherit the implementation's transport choices.
