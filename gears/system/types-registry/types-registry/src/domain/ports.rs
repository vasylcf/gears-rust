//! The persistence ports the domain calls, and the row and input types that cross
//! them.
//!
//! SPEC §8 makes acceptance and admission each one transaction, so the transaction
//! boundary is a business rule and the domain orchestrates it: the transaction
//! crosses the boundary as `&DbTx<'_>`. What the ports hide is every `SeaORM` type
//! — entities, active models, column enums — so the domain names `toolkit_db` and
//! nothing below it. The row and input types below are what the repositories in
//! `infra::storage::repo` themselves take and return, which is why `store.rs`
//! forwards without translating.
//!
//! # Why every port takes `&DbTx<'_>` and not a runner
//!
//! Three candidates, and the first two are unavailable rather than unattractive:
//!
//! - `&impl DBRunner` on a trait method makes the trait non-dyn-safe, which would
//!   push a type parameter through every domain function into the gear's wiring.
//!   `Arc<dyn Stores>` would be impossible.
//! - `&dyn DBRunner` *can be built* — sealing prevents implementing the trait, not
//!   coercing to it — but cannot be *executed on*: the secure query API spells its
//!   parameter `&impl DBRunner` (`toolkit-db/src/secure/select.rs`), whose implicit
//!   `Sized` bound an unsized `dyn` runner fails. `toolkit_db::outbox` opted out
//!   with `&(impl DBRunner + Sync + ?Sized)`; the secure API has not.
//! - `&DbTx<'_>` is concrete, so the traits stay dyn-safe. Its cost is that
//!   **every** port call runs inside a transaction, reads included — the
//!   deliberate choice, because a read that consults two tables must not straddle
//!   a concurrent commit (see [`snapshot_read`]).
//!
//! The repositories underneath keep `runner: &impl DBRunner` as
//! `11_database_patterns.md` prescribes, so they stay usable outside a
//! transaction. That is the whole difference between a repository and a port here.
//!
//! # Rows mirror their tables
//!
//! Each `*Row` carries every column of its table rather than the subset today's
//! callers read, so a rule that starts consulting one more column needs no port
//! change. The mapping is a field-for-field move the compiler checks.
