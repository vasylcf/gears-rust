//! The three non-stored family rules: kind, minor shape, minor contiguity.
//!
//! All three are asked of a **new member** only. A content revision adds nobody to
//! the family, so it is not gated here — which is also why closing a region cannot
//! freeze the entities already in it (SPEC §8.1 step 3).
//!
//! # Each rule is one exact lookup, never a scan
//!
//! `database.sql` fixes which single identifier decides each question:
//!
//! ```text
//! shape, minor-bearing candidate vM.n~   -> refuse while vM~ exists
//! shape, major-only candidate vM~        -> refuse while vM.0~ exists
//! contiguity, candidate vM.n~ with n > 0 -> refuse unless vM.(n-1)~ exists
//! ```
//!
//! Shape and contiguity are scoped to one **major**, as the compatibility chain is,
//! so a family may hold a major-only `v1~` beside a minor-bearing `v2.0~`. The kind
//! rule is the family-wide one, because a family key deliberately maps a type and an
//! Instance spelling onto one row and one of them has to lose.
//!
//! # Tombstones count
//!
//! A `DELETED` member still decides shape and still satisfies contiguity: its
//! definition remains the compatibility baseline until purge, so skipping it would
//! let an ordinary deletion move the baseline. Both fall out of one primitive,
//! `EntityStore::find_by_gts_id` returning tombstones.
//!
//! The predecessor is deliberately **not** a dependency edge and not part of the
//! revision vector: such an edge would forbid deleting `v1.0~` while `v1.1~` exists,
//! which ADR-0008 permits and ADR-0004 relies on.
