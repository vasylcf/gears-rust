//! One admission unit: evaluate a candidate against its transient store, then
//! commit it (SPEC §8.1, worker steps 3 and 4).
//!
//! The split between the two halves is the point of this module. Evaluation is
//! everything expensive and everything fallible for content reasons — building the
//! store, resolving references, composing effective traits, meta-compiling the
//! schema — and runs with **no transaction open**. The transaction that follows
//! holds only the commit-time rechecks and the writes, so a slow validation never
//! holds a row lock and a failed one never opened it.
//!
//! P0 scope here is T8's: one acyclic, reference-free candidate per unit. In-batch
//! resolution and SCC ordering are T19, compatibility T17, dependency edges T13,
//! the revision-vector guard T15 — each adds a step to `evaluate` or `commit`
//! without moving the boundary between them.
