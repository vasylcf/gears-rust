//! Admission: the synchronous acceptance half (T7) and the request identity it
//! rests on.
//!
//! The split is SPEC §8.1's: **acceptance** runs in the caller's task, reads no
//! entity state, and either refuses synchronously or commits one operation row,
//! its items and an outbox message in a single transaction. **Admission** — the
//! worker — is a separate pass driven by that outbox message.
//!
//! Everything before the transaction is a pure function of the request and the
//! configuration. That is not a style choice: SPEC §8.1's ordering invariant is
//! that the policy gate precedes any existence lookup, so a refusal cannot probe
//! the namespace, and the cheapest way to keep that true is for the refusing code
//! to have no database in scope at all.
