/// A [`PgPoolOptions`] with the `after_connect`/`before_acquire` hooks wired
/// (DESIGN.md §3.4) — callers still need to chain `.max_connections(...)`,
/// `.acquire_timeout(...)`, and `.connect(...)`.
///
/// `after_connect` pins every connection's `search_path` to `schema` so the
/// migrations' unqualified `CREATE TABLE`s land in the same schema the runtime
/// queries target with their `{schema}.cluster_*` qualifiers (PGR-L4). `schema`
/// must already have passed [`validate_schema`] — it is interpolated unquoted.
///
/// **No `after_release` hook.** An earlier revision swept every checked-in
/// connection with `pg_advisory_unlock_all()`, because back then a lock
/// acquisition ran `pg_try_advisory_lock` on a *pooled* connection and a cancelled
/// acquisition could return one to the pool still holding a live lock. No lock
/// takes an advisory lock at all now — the `cluster_lock` row is the arbiter
/// (DESIGN.md §5.1) — so the sweep would be a pure per-checkin round-trip on the
/// cache hot path, doubling the pool's per-operation hook overhead to protect
/// against a state this crate can no longer produce. Since the liveness beacon was
/// removed (DESIGN.md) this crate takes **no** advisory lock
/// anywhere, pooled or otherwise.
///
/// One caveat, stated precisely because it is easy to get wrong: `sqlx`'s own
/// `Migrator::run` **does** take an advisory lock on a pooled connection, and it is
/// the *blocking* single-`bigint` form. Reading `sqlx 0.8.6`
/// (`sqlx-core/src/migrate/migrator.rs`), `conn.lock()` is taken first, every step
/// after it is `?`-propagated, and `conn.unlock()` is reached **only on the success
/// path** — so a migration that fails partway (dirty version, checksum mismatch,
/// failing DDL) returns that connection to the pool still holding the migrator's
/// lock, and neither builder here calls `pool.close()` on that path (the pool is
/// merely dropped). Two things keep that from mattering today: the migrator's key
/// uses the one-argument form (`pg_locks.objsubid = 1`) which cannot collide with
/// this plugin's two-argument keys (`objsubid = 2`), and a failed
/// `build_and_start` propagates to a caller that discards the whole handle, so the
/// sockets do close. Anything that starts reusing a pool across a failed
/// `build_and_start` would need to revisit this.
