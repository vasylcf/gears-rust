//! Shutdown machinery shared by both plugin handles — [`PostgresClusterHandle`]
//! (cache + lock) and [`PostgresLockHandle`] (lock only) — DESIGN.md §10.
//!
//! Both handles end the same way: cancel the shared `CancellationToken`, join
//! the background tasks, then close the pool — leaving held lease rows in place,
//! which is DESIGN.md's whole point (a restart is not a lease
//! event). The two steps that are *not* obvious live here rather than in
//! either handle, because each one is a property of the pair and the pair had
//! already drifted on both:
//!
//! * [`close_pool`] bounds the final `PgPool::close()`. `PostgresLockHandle`
//!   used it; `PostgresClusterHandle` called `pool.close()` directly, so the
//!   bound DESIGN.md §10 and §11 both describe existed in the standalone plugin
//!   and not in the combined one that actually ships.
//! * [`cancel_and_diagnose_drop`] is the `Drop` backstop for a `stop()` that
//!   never completed. `PostgresLockHandle::drop` cancelled the token first;
//!   `PostgresClusterHandle::drop` did not, so a dropped `stop()` future leaked
//!   every background task and the pool with them — while DESIGN.md §11 asserted
//!   that "both handle `Drop`s also cancel the shared token".
//!
//! One implementation each, so neither can drift again: the shape of the bug in
//! both cases was two copies of one rule.

/// a branch body already running) nor awaited anywhere — and against an
/// unresponsive backend `sqlx` applies no read timeout of its own. Unbounded, that

/// budget for and into a step with no budget at all. Cache operations share the
/// same pool and the same exposure, which is the other reason this belongs here
/// rather than under `lock/`.
///
/// Bounding it is safe because `close()` marks the pool closed *before* it starts
/// waiting: giving up on the wait still leaves the pool closed, idle connections
