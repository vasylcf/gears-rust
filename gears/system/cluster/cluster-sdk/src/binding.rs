//! What a facade binds to, and the steps that bind it
//! (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! Every resolver runs the same four steps, so they live here once rather than
//! three times:
//!
//! 1. **Take the process's `dyn ClusterClient` from the hub.** There is exactly
//!    one (invariant I4), and which implementation it is decides nothing here —
//!    that was settled by whoever registered it (§4.9.1).
//! 2. **Ask it for this profile's backend.** Sync and pure in both profiles: the
//!    real backend `Arc` locally, a remote handle remotely. No I/O.
//! 3. **Await this profile's descriptor, bounded.** The only `await` on the
//!    resolve path, and the reason `resolve()` is `async` at all (§4.7.1,
//!    obstacle A). It waits on the descriptor, never on cluster becoming
//!    reachable (invariant I6).
//! 4. **Validate the declared requirements against it** — inline when the
//!    descriptor landed, deferred to the readiness contributor when it did not.
//!
//! # There is no fallback branch
//!
//! The steps are the same code in both deployment profiles, and no step asks
//! which profile it is running in. A profile cannot resolve *toward* anything
//! other than what was registered, so the split-brain hazard a mode flag would
//! have to guard against is structurally absent rather than merely checked
//! (§4.9.3).
//!
//! # Validation reads the descriptor, not the backend
//!
//! Today's resolvers validate against the bound backend's own `consistency()` /
//! `features()` / `provider_name()`. A remote handle cannot answer those without
//! a descriptor, so the descriptor becomes the single source for **both**
//! profiles rather than one path reading the backend and the other reading the
//! wire. Locally the descriptor is computed from the real backends, so the answer
//! is identical — and the error text is now byte-identical across profiles, which
//! is what the inline-validation parity gate asserts (test gate "Inline
//! validation").
//!
//! One thing does change on the config-driven path: `CapabilityNotMet.provider`
//! becomes the provider name the **operator wrote** (`postgres`) rather than the
//! concrete Rust type behind it. That is what §5.5 asks for — an operator reading
//! a capability failure has to see which real backend failed the requirement.
//!
//! # An empty hub yields an unbound backend, not an error
//!
//! When no client is registered, `resolve()` returns `Ok` and the facade is built
//! over an [`UnboundCacheBackend`] (or its lock / leader-election sibling): a
//! backend whose every operation is
//! [`ClusterError::ProfileNotBound`](crate::ClusterError::ProfileNotBound) and
//! whose synchronous accessors answer with the weakest reading, so a declared
//! requirement can only fail rather than be falsely satisfied. That is §4.9.1's
//! rule — absence is tolerated by `resolve()`, named by the first call, and
//! reported by readiness — with no new error variant (invariant I3) and no branch
//! on the call path: the facade holds one `Arc<dyn _Backend>` either way, exactly
//! as it does today.
