/// The plugin contract a distributed-lock backend implements.
///
/// The facade holds an `Arc<dyn DistributedLockBackend>`, so the trait must be
/// dyn-compatible (asserted at the bottom of this module). Every fallible
/// method returns [`ClusterError`].
///
/// # TTL safety-net contract
///
/// Every acquisition carries a consumer-supplied `ttl`. The backend attaches it
/// to the lock entry at acquisition (`cpt-cf-clst-algo-distributed-lock-ttl-safety`,
/// `inst-ts-attach`) and **automatically releases** the entry once the TTL
/// elapses if the holder crashes or never releases (`inst-ts-auto`). This
/// bounds the leak window handed to the next acquirer (`inst-ts-return`) — the
/// safety net that replaces fencing tokens (ADR-002). [`LockGuard::renew`]
/// pushes the deadline out for a longer critical section.
///
/// # Two halves, one lease
///
/// [`try_lock`](DistributedLockBackend::try_lock) / [`lock`](DistributedLockBackend::lock)
/// hand back a [`LockGuard`]; [`acquire`](DistributedLockBackend::acquire) /
/// [`acquire_waiting`](DistributedLockBackend::acquire_waiting) hand back the
/// [`LeaseToken`] the guard cannot carry, and
/// [`renew`](DistributedLockBackend::renew) / [`release`](DistributedLockBackend::release)
/// operate on that token. The second half exists because a remote caller must be
/// able to renew from somewhere other than the acquiring task — and, once the lease
/// is a record in the store, from a *replica that never saw the acquire* (§5.8.1,
/// invariant I7). A backend should serve both from one lease rather than two
/// mechanisms; the four lease methods are defaulted, so one that has not yet done
/// so still compiles and reports [`ClusterError::Unsupported`] (invariant I11).
///
/// # Release-if-still-holder contract
///
/// Release is conditional (`cpt-cf-clst-algo-distributed-lock-release-if-holder`).
/// On a [`LockRequest::Release`](crate::lock::LockRequest::Release) the backend
/// compares the requester's holder identity against the current entry
/// (`inst-rh-compare`); if the requester is no longer the holder — the TTL
/// lapsed and another participant re-acquired — it returns **without** deleting
/// the foreign holder's entry (`inst-rh-foreign`/`inst-rh-skip`), and otherwise
/// deletes the entry conditionally (`inst-rh-release`). A foreign holder
/// therefore cannot release another's lock.
///
/// # Guard command channel
///
/// `try_lock` / `lock` return a [`LockGuard`] created via
/// [`LockGuard::channel`]. The backend owns the paired
/// [`LockCommandReceiver`](crate::lock::LockCommandReceiver), selects on its
/// `recv`, and completes each [`LockRequest`](crate::lock::LockRequest) through
/// its responder with the real outcome. Dropping the guard without releasing
/// yields `None` from `recv`; the backend does nothing and the entry lapses via
/// TTL.
///
/// # Advisory vs. linearizable semantics
///
/// A backend declaring `linearizable == false` provides only advisory
/// coordination and may transiently grant the same lock to two holders under
/// partition. Consumers needing correctness-grade exclusion require
/// [`LockCapability::Linearizable`](crate::lock::LockCapability::Linearizable)
/// at resolution.
