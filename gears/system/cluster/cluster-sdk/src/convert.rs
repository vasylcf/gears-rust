//! The `ClusterError` ⇄ `CanonicalError` codec — DESIGN.md
//!
//! **Two-layer model.** [`ClusterError`] stays the frozen Rust-facing contract
//! consumers match on (invariant I3 — no new variants, no widened fields).
//! `CanonicalError`'s RFC 9457 [`Problem`] envelope is what crosses the boundary.
//! [`ClusterWireError`] is the typed enum in between, and
//! `#[derive(ContractError)]` generates its two `Problem` conversions, so cluster
//! defines no bespoke error DTO and no hand-written code-mapping table.
//!
//! # Why this module is unfeatured
//!
//! The **encode** direction runs in the cluster gear, which links no client
//! (§6.9). Only the decode direction has a remote caller, and it costs nothing to
//! compile alongside.
//!
//! # The mapping is not injective, and that is the whole difficulty
//!
//! Three canonical categories are reached by two `ClusterError` variants each:
//!
//! | Category | Reached by | Distinguished by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ServiceUnavailable` | `Shutdown`, `Provider{ConnectionLost}` | `error_code` |
//! | `DeadlineExceeded` | `LockTimeout`, `Provider{Timeout}` | `error_code` |
//! | `Internal` | `Provider{AuthFailure}`, `Provider{Other}` | `error_code` |
//!
//! `Shutdown` is terminal while `Provider{ConnectionLost}` is retryable, and
//! [`RestartingWatch`](crate::restart::RestartingWatch) reads retryability from
//! [`ProviderErrorKind`]. Inferring the kind from the canonical category would
//! therefore make the auto-restart combinator retry a shutdown forever. So
//! **[`ProviderErrorKind`] travels explicitly**: [`ClusterWireError`] carries one
//! variant per kind, each with its own `error_code`, and the derived
//! `TryFrom<Problem>` keys on `(error_domain, error_code)` and never on the
//! category.
//!
//! Splitting `Provider` per kind is what makes §6.9's table expressible at all —
//! `#[derive(ContractError)]` takes one `#[canonical(..)]` per *variant*, and the
//! five kinds map to four different categories. It also keeps
//! `cpt-cf-clst-constraint-no-serde` intact: nothing here requires a serde derive
//! on [`ProviderErrorKind`] itself, nor a mirror of it.
//!
//! # A lease-keyed `NotFound` is not a cache miss
//!
//! `renew` / `release` / `resign` predicate on `(name, owner, fence, deadline)`,
//! so "zero rows" covers expired, released and fenced-out alike — deliberately
//! indistinguishable, so tokens are not probeable (§5.8.1). Which
//! [`ClusterError`] that becomes depends on **which operation asked**, which is
//! why [`to_cluster_error`] takes a [`LeaseContext`] and is a real function rather
//! than a `From` impl on the canonical variant.
//!
//! The mapping applies only when the code is **unrecognised**, never over a typed
//! answer. §6.2 has the server return `lock_expired` for a lease predicate that
//! matched nothing, so [`LeaseContext`] is the defence for a *bare* canonical
//! `NotFound` — one arriving from an intermediary, or from a peer that did not
//! type its error — rather than the normal path. Letting it override a typed code
//! would make it possible for the caller's guess to contradict the server.
//!
//! # Both conversion directions match exhaustively, deliberately
//!
//! [`ClusterError`] and [`ClusterWireError`] are both `#[non_exhaustive]`, which
//! constrains downstream crates but not this one. So there is no catch-all arm in
//! either `From` impl: adding a variant to either enum **fails this build**, which
//! for a frozen error model (invariant I3) and an additive-only wire (invariant
//! I12) is the outcome to want. A catch-all would turn the same change into a
//! variant silently collapsing to `Provider{Other}` — retryability and all —
//! discovered in production rather than at compile time.
