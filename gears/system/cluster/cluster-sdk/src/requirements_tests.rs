//! `K5`'s exit criteria over the real registry (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! # Why these drive a local registry rather than the process one
//!
//! [`requirements()`] is process-global by design, and `cargo test` runs a target's
//! tests **in one process, in parallel**. Tests that shared it would record into each
//! other's state and the whole suite would be order-dependent — so every test here
//! builds its own [`RequirementRegistry`], which is exactly the same type the process
//! one is. The two tests that must exercise the *global* path
//! ([`the_process_registry_is_one_per_process`] and the `bind` integration in
//! `binding_tests.rs`) say so.
//!
//! # And why they do not assert a process exit
//!
//! The escalation rule is asserted as a **decision** ([`escalation_due`]), never as
//! an action. Wiring it to `std::process::exit` is deliberately not implemented (see
//! `escalation_due`'s docs), and a test that could trigger one would take
//! the whole test binary down with it — under a paused clock, advancing five minutes
//! is one line.
