//! The remote leader-election backend — DESIGN.md
//!
//! Three unary methods that are one RPC each, and one — `elect` — that is a
//! whole state machine, because [`LeaderWatch`] is a *managed* election and the
//! wire carries only the lease.
//!
//! # Transitions are derived client-side, in both deployment profiles
//!
//! The server announces no leadership. It cannot: a holder keeps its claim by
//! renewing, and renewal is client-driven precisely so that renewal stays the
//! consumer-liveness proxy (§7.3, invariant I8). So the pump derives its own
//! status exactly the way the in-process default's renewal loop does:
//!
//! | Transition | Derived from |
//! |---|---|
//! | leader keeps the claim | `renew` answering `Ok` |
//! | leader loses the claim | `renew` answering `lock_expired` — lapsed, stolen, or fenced out, deliberately indistinguishable (§5.8.1) |
//! | follower wins the claim | a re-`join` on the renewal cadence coming back `Leader` |
//!
//! The `await_change` subscription carries only what a client *cannot* derive:
//! `Closed(Shutdown)` and the `Status(Lost)` that precedes it on a drain, plus
//! `Lagged` and `Reset` (§6.6). That symmetry is what keeps invariant I1 true
//! here — one consumer source file, one set of observable transitions.
//!
//! # A follower's re-`join` mints a server-side subscription every time
//!
//! `join` calls `ElectionSubscriptions::open` unconditionally
//! (`cluster/src/api/grpc/leader.rs`), and this pump keeps its **original**
//! `election_id` and stream across a re-join, so every re-claim attempt leaves an
//! *unattached* subscription behind. Nothing closes it today: the serving gear
//! never calls `close`, and the sweep that would is item `S2`, gated on `A6`.
//!
//! Unattached-and-abandoned is precisely the class `A6` specifies a sweep for, so
//! this needs no new mechanism — but it turns that sweep from hygiene into a
//! **prerequisite for Profile 3**, because a steady-state follower produces one
//! per renewal interval (one every 10 s on the default config) rather than one per
//! crashed client. **Shipped as `S2`**: the
//! server sweeps abandoned subscriptions on a 5 s cadence (§5.4.1). The cheaper
//! server-side alternative — `join` reusing the caller's existing subscription for
//! the same election — turned out to be unavailable, because under v1's
//! `TrustedNetwork` mode every caller resolves to one name and `(caller, election)`
//! therefore identifies the fleet rather than a participant.
//!
//! # Dropping the watch stops the pump, and that is load-bearing
//!
//! [`LeaderWatch`]'s contract is that `Drop` does no I/O and leadership lapses
//! through TTL expiry. Lapsing requires that **something stop renewing**, and the
//! only thing renewing is this pump — so the resign channel closing is not merely
//! a tidy-up signal, it is what makes the documented contract true.
//!
//! It was missed once, in a way worth recording because the code read as correct.
//! The arm was written `Some(responder) = resigns.recv()`, and a `select!` branch
//! whose refutable pattern fails is **disabled for that iteration** rather than
//! taken — so the `None` a dropped watch produces was silently discarded on every
//! pass and a leader whose consumer had vanished renewed its claim forever. In
//! Profile 1 the same arm is a `match` with an explicit `None => break`, so the two
//! profiles disagreed about whether a dropped watch ever frees the election, which
//! invariant I1 forbids. Found while testing `S2`, and asserted in both profiles
//! now rather than in neither.
