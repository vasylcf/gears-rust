    /// gear's `start`, never its `init`, and both are already `async fn`.

    /// per-profile hub registration: the client is what a remote consumer has, and

    /// what happens when no client is registered — `Ok`, and a facade that reports
    /// [`ClusterError::ProfileNotBound`] on first use (§4.9.1).

    /// - [`ClusterError::ProfileNotSpecified`] if no profile was set.
    /// - [`ClusterError::InvalidName`] if the bound profile's
    ///   [`NAME`](ClusterProfile::NAME) violates [`CLUSTER_NAME_RULE`](crate::CLUSTER_NAME_RULE).
    /// - [`ClusterError::ProfileNotBound`] if a cluster client is registered but
    ///   binds no cache backend for the profile.
    /// - [`ClusterError::CapabilityNotMet`] if a declared capability is
    ///   unsupported by the bound backend, and the profile's descriptor was
    ///   obtainable within the SDK's bounded resolve timeout.
    ///   When it was not, validation is deferred to the readiness contributor and
