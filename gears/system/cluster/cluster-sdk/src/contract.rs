//! The `cluster.v1` contract traits — DESIGN.md
//!
//! **The wire mirrors the backend traits, not the facades.** Everything the
//! facades do locally — resolution, `scoped()`, cached `status()`, `is_leader()`,
//! `auto_restart`, the polling prefix-watch polyfill — stays above the §3.1 seam
//! and never reaches the wire (§6.3).
//!
//! Four contracts: one per coordination primitive, plus the profile/admin one
//! that makes the backends' synchronous accessors answerable remotely (§5.5).
//!
//! # The two-trait split is load-bearing
//!
//! `ContractKind::from_suffix` classifies a contract by its trait-name suffix, and
//! `is_remote_capable()` returns true for **`Api` and `Backend` alike**. Cluster's
//! plugin-facing traits are named [`ClusterCacheBackend`](crate::ClusterCacheBackend),
//! [`DistributedLockBackend`](crate::DistributedLockBackend) and
//! [`LeaderElectionBackend`](crate::LeaderElectionBackend). Annotating *those* with
//! `#[toolkit::contract]` plus a projection — rather than the separate `*Api`
//! traits here — would classify them remote-capable and push a security-context
//! parameter onto the trait **every plugin implements**, breaking
//! `cpt-cf-clst-nfr-plugin-stability` (invariant I11) for no benefit. `*Backend`
//! stays local and serde-free; `*Api` carries the wire contract (§6.2, ADR-011).
//!
//! # Every method takes a platform-plane security context, via `#[secctx]`
//!
//! `cpt-cf-binding-constraint-security-context` requires a security-plane context
//! as the first non-`self` argument of every method on a remote-capable contract.
//! Cluster takes the **platform-plane** form: cluster is platform-plane
//! infrastructure, and the context carries no tenant.
//!
//! The parameter is marked with the explicit `#[secctx]` attribute rather than
//! relying on the `ctx:`-name heuristic, and that is **required, not stylistic**.
//! `#[toolkit::contract]`'s heuristic matches a parameter named `ctx` whose type
//! path ends in the segment `SecurityContext` (`parse.rs`), and
//! `PlatformSecurityContext` does not — the idents are compared whole. Without the
//! attribute the context would be classified `FieldRole::Wire` and protogen would
//! put it *on the wire*, since it filters on exactly that role. The attribute is
//! consumed by the macro and never appears on the emitted trait.
//!
//! It costs nothing on the wire either way: the role filters it out of the
//! generated schema, so the credential still travels in gRPC metadata and resolves
//! server-side as §4.6 describes. It is a signature requirement, not a payload one.
//!
//! # Every method returns a named DTO
//!
//! Including the ones whose backend counterpart returns `()` or `bool` — see the
//! [`dto`](crate::dto) module docs for why the merged protogen requires it and why
//! invariant I12 wants it.
//!
//! # Annotations
//!
//! `#[idempotency(..)]` on every method feeds the IR (§6.10). The classification
//! is not cosmetic: **no acquisition method is idempotent**, because a retried
//! `try_lock` or `join` whose first response was lost reports contention against
//! the caller's *own* lease — a silent wrong answer rather than an error. The
//! `#[retryable]` marker that actually licenses a generated client to retry lives
//! on the gRPC projection (item `C2`), and must never appear on an acquisition.
