//! # Cluster SDK foundation
//!
//! `cluster_sdk` is the shared, serde-free, dyn-safe contract foundation every
//! cluster coordination primitive (cache, leader election, distributed lock)
//! builds on. It provides the cross-cutting types and
//! helpers that let the public contract evolve independently of any backend:
//!
//! - [`ClusterError`] — the unified error model, plus [`ProviderErrorKind`]
//!   for programmatic retryability classification.
//! - [`ClusterClient`] — the one cluster object per process: a factory for the
//!   three backend traits, satisfied in-process by the cluster gear and remotely
//!   by the gRPC client (DESIGN.md). Unfeatured, because
//!   Profile 1 needs the trait in a process that links no transport.
//! - [`ProfileDescriptor`] — what a profile's three bindings declare, which is
//!   what makes the backends' synchronous accessors answerable remotely (§5.5).
//! - [`ClusterProfile`] — the typed profile marker (the sole consumer-facing
//!   profile path; internal `profile_scope` resolution is `pub(crate)`), with the
//!   [`validate_cluster_name`] helper for validating coordination names.
//! - [`assert_dyn_compatible!`] — a compile-time dyn-compatibility assertion
//!   harness applied per backend trait so any change that breaks
//!   dyn-compatibility fails the build.
