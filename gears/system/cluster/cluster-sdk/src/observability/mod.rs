//! Versioned observability naming contract for the cluster SDK (ADR-004).
//!
//! Observability signals are part of the cluster contract, on par with Rust
//! trait signatures. Every follow-up plugin emits spans, metrics, and log
//! events against the stable names defined here so that operator dashboards
//! and alerts are portable across providers and survive plugin minor versions.
//! The concrete catalog — with attribute keys, label sets, and severities — is
//! maintained in [`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`]. Renaming, removing, or relabeling a
//! signal is a breaking change requiring a major SDK version bump; additions
//! are non-breaking.
//!
//! # Naming conventions
//!
//! - **Spans** — OpenTelemetry style, dotted lowercase: `cluster.<primitive>.<op>`.
//! - **Metrics** — Prometheus style, underscored lowercase: `cluster_<primitive>_<subject>_<unit>`.
//! - **Log events** — dotted lowercase event names emitted via `tracing` at the
//!   severity documented in the catalog.
//!
//! # Cardinality rule (hard contract)
//!
//! Operation keys, lock names, election names, and service instance IDs — the
//! values in [`fields::attr`] — **never** appear as metric labels. They are
//! unbounded and would explode Prometheus cardinality. They may appear only as
//! span attributes (traces are sampled) and log-event fields (log volume is
//! filter-controlled). Metric labels are restricted to the bounded, enum-like
//! dimensions in [`fields::label`], enumerated by [`METRIC_LABEL_ALLOWLIST`].
//!
