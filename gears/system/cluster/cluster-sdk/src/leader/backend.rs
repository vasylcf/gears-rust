/// The plugin contract a leader-election backend implements.
///
/// The facade holds an `Arc<dyn LeaderElectionBackend>`, so the trait must be
/// dyn-compatible (asserted at the bottom of this module). Every fallible
/// method returns [`ClusterError`].
///
/// # Automatic renewal contract
///
/// `elect` / `elect_with_config` join a named election and return a
/// [`LeaderWatch`]. The backend owns a background renewal task that, per
/// `cpt-cf-clst-algo-leader-election-renewal`:
///
/// - renews the claim on the derived [`ElectionConfig::renewal_interval`];
/// - retries transient backend errors (`ConnectionLost`, `Timeout`,
///   `ResourceExhausted`) **internally**, never surfacing them as transitions;
/// - emits [`LeaderWatchEvent::Status(Lost)`](crate::leader::LeaderWatchEvent::Status)
///   only after renewals fail past `max_missed_renewals`, then auto-reenrolls
///   and resolves to `Leader` or `Follower`;
/// - keeps the cached snapshot coherent with the emitted events by driving both
///   through [`LeaderWatchSender::send_status`](crate::leader::LeaderWatchSender::send_status).
///
/// # Shutdown contract
///
/// On graceful shutdown the backend delivers `Status(Lost)` then a terminal
/// `Closed(ClusterError::Shutdown)` to every active watch, and completes
/// in-flight [`resign`](crate::leader::LeaderWatch::resign) requests on a
/// best-effort basis.
///
/// # Advisory semantics
///
/// Election is advisory coordination — *which* node should run a workload, not
/// mutual exclusion. Backends declaring `linearizable == false` may transiently
/// elect two leaders under partition; consumers needing correctness-critical
/// exclusion combine this with a distributed lock or cache compare-and-swap.
