//! `ClientHub` registration and deregistration helpers, keyed per profile per
//! primitive (DESIGN §3.6).
//!
//! The cluster gear's wiring composes them: it iterates the operator-declared
//! profile×primitive matrix and calls one `register_*_backend` per cell at
//! startup and the matching `deregister_*_backend` at shutdown.
//!
//! # What these no longer do, since `K4`
//!
//! **Registering a backend here does not by itself make a profile resolvable.**
//! A consumer's `resolve()` goes through the process's single
//! `dyn ClusterClient` (DESIGN.md), because that is the
//! only object a *remote* consumer has and routing both deployment profiles
//! through it is what keeps them one code path. The gear's `LocalClusterClient`
//! answers from its `ProfileRegistry`, and these scoped entries are the same
//! instances that registry holds — asserted by pointer equality, not assumed.
//!
//! So these helpers remain the process-local binding record: what the hub can
//! enumerate for diagnostics, what `ClusterHandle::stop` unbinds, and the
//! identity check that the local client interposes nothing. A programmatic caller
//! that wants a *resolvable* profile wants `ClusterWiring`, which registers the
//! client too.
//!
//! The profile is a runtime `&str` (not a typed [`ClusterProfile`] marker)
//! because wiring reads profile names from operator configuration. The name is
//! validated through [`profile_scope`]; an invalid name is rejected with
//! [`ClusterError::InvalidName`] before any hub mutation.
//!
//! **Registration is last-write-wins.** Each `register_*_backend` inserts
//! unconditionally into the hub, so registering a second backend for the same
//! profile×primitive cell silently replaces the first and still returns
//! `Ok(())` — there is no already-bound signal. The wiring crate must therefore
//! treat the operator-declared profile×primitive matrix as the source of
//! uniqueness (reject duplicate cells in config) rather than relying on these
//! helpers to detect a double-bind.
//!
