//! String interning for the `&'static str` fields the frozen error model keeps.
//!
//! DESIGN.md notes that two independent places need this for
//! the same reason, and argues for one helper rather than two ad-hoc leaks:
//!
//! - [`ClusterError::ProfileNotBound`](crate::ClusterError::ProfileNotBound),
//!   [`CapabilityNotMet`](crate::ClusterError::CapabilityNotMet),
//!   [`Unsupported`](crate::ClusterError::Unsupported) and
//!   [`InvalidName`](crate::ClusterError::InvalidName) carry `&'static str`, and
//!   the error model is **frozen** (invariant I3). A name arriving over the wire,
//!   or read from runtime config, must be promoted rather than the variant
//!   widened to `String`.
//! - `provider_name()` on the three backend traits returns `&'static str`, while
//!   a remote backend learns its provider from a descriptor at runtime (§5.5).
//!
//! Interning is therefore the mechanism that keeps both signatures unchanged
//! across the process boundary — which makes invariant I2 ("`resolve()`
//! becoming `async` is the only SDK signature change") survive contact with a
//! wire that speaks `String`.
//!
//! # It leaks, deliberately and boundedly
//!
//! The interned set is drawn from the cluster gear's configured profile and
//! provider names plus the capability and feature identifiers compiled into the
//! SDK — all fixed for the life of a process, and all already `&'static str` on
//! the local path. It is **not** a general-purpose intern table: nothing keyed by
//! a lock name, an election name or a cache key may reach it, because those are
//! unbounded (the same cardinality rule as invariant I15).
