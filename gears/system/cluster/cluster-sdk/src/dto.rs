//! Wire DTOs for the cluster coordination contract (`cluster.v1`).
//!
//! DESIGN.md These are serde + schemars mirrors of the SDK's
//! coordination types, kept separate rather than derived onto the types
//! themselves because `cpt-cf-clst-constraint-no-serde` constrains the
//! coordination *contract* types ([`CacheEntry`](crate::cache::CacheEntry) and
//! siblings) to stay serde-free. The conversions between the two are explicit
//! and live here.
//!
//! # Why this module is unfeatured
//!
//! The transport is optional; the descriptor is not. [`ProfileDescriptor`] is
//! what makes a backend's *synchronous* `consistency()` / `features()` /
//! `provider_name()` answerable at all (§5.5), and it is the return type of
//! [`ClusterClient::descriptor`](crate::client::ClusterClient::descriptor) —
//! which Profile 1 implements in a process where no gRPC client is linked
//! (§3.1). So the descriptor family carries no transport dependency and no
//! feature gate.
//!
//! # Descriptors are per profile, per primitive
//!
//! A profile binds up to three backends, and each declares its own features and
//! its own provider. The provider recorded here is always the **server-side**
//! one (`"postgres"`), never `"remote"`: when a capability requirement fails,
//! the operator has to see which real backend failed it (§5.5).
//!
//! # Three rules shape every request/response type here
//!
//! - **Every request carries `profile`.** The profile is a request parameter, not
//!   a wiring parameter: the cluster gear resolves it to a bound backend on
//!   arrival (§3.1, §5.2).
//! - **Lease-keyed operations carry a [`LeaseToken`], never a handle.** The lease
//!   is a record in the backing store, so any replica can serve any operation
//!   against it (§5.8.1, invariant I7).
//! - **Every method returns a *named* response type**, including the ones whose
//!   backend counterpart returns `()` or `bool`. Two reasons, both checked
//!   against the merged toolchain rather than assumed:
//!   `toolkit-contract-protogen`'s `method_output_type` accepts only
//!   `TypeRef::Named` — a primitive return is an explicit
//!   `PrimitiveMethodReturn` error and a unit return has no mapping at all — and
//!   a bare `()` could never later grow a field without a wire break, which
//!   invariant I12 forbids. `PutResponse` is empty today and stays additive.
