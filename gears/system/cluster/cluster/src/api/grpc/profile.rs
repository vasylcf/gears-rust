//! The profile/discovery service (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! One call, and it is what makes a *remote* backend's **synchronous**
//! `consistency()` / `features()` / `provider_name()` answerable at all: the
//! client fetches descriptors once after wiring and then answers those accessors
//! from its cache, without a call per question (§5.5).
//!
//! # It reads the registry snapshot, not the backends
//!
//! Descriptors are computed at wiring time from the real backends and carried on
//! [`BoundProfile`](crate::BoundProfile) (item `R2`), so serving this call touches
//! no backend and does no I/O — which lets `resolve()` await it under a
//! bound timeout without startup ever blocking on cluster reachability
//! (invariant I6).
//!
//! Profiles enumerate in **name order**, because the snapshot is a `BTreeMap`, so
//! the response is deterministic across replicas and across calls.
//!
//! # The generation is the point of the response, not decoration
//!
//! It is §5.6's staleness detector: a client re-reads descriptors when the
//! generation it holds no longer matches, rather than polling for a diff.
