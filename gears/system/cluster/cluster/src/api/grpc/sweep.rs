//! The abandoned-subscription sweep — DESIGN.md (ask `A6`,
//! decision 18), item `S2`.
//!
//! [`ElectionSubscriptions`](super::ElectionSubscriptions) holds the state and
//! decides which entries are abandoned; this module holds the *schedule* — the
//! cadence, the grace window, the background task, and the two metrics §5.4.1
//! contracts.
//!
//! # Why this exists, and why it is not hygiene
//!
//! `join` opens a subscription unconditionally, and a follower re-`join`s on the
//! renewal cadence because the server announces no leadership (§6.6). The client
//! pump keeps its original `election_id`, so every re-claim attempt leaves an
//! unattached entry behind — **one per renewal interval**, one every 10 s on the
//! default `ElectionConfig`. Measured before this was written: a follower took the
//! table from 2 entries to 6 across five 100 ms intervals
//! (`tests/remote_backends.rs`). Without a sweep that is unbounded growth in a
//! steady state, not merely in a failure mode.
//!
//! The same pass covers the case decision 18 was actually written about — a client
//! that vanished without closing its stream — because both look identical from
//! here: an entry no reader is holding.
//!
//! # The cheaper fix, and why it is not available
//!
//! Having `join` reuse the caller's existing subscription for the same election
//! would fix the *rate* at its source. It cannot be keyed safely: under v1's
//! `TrustedNetwork` mode every caller resolves to the single name
//! `unauthenticated` (`identity::UNAUTHENTICATED_CALLER`), so `(caller, election)`
//! names the whole fleet rather than a participant, and even under a real
//! authenticator two replicas of one Deployment share a `ServiceAccount` name.
//! Telling those apart is the entire reason the id is a fresh UUID. The sweep
//! bounds the population either way, so it is both the necessary fix and the
//! sufficient one (§5.4.1).
