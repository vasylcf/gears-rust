/// handle than the one that acquired it, and therefore through a different cluster
/// replica (invariant I7).

/// ([`acquire`](DistributedLockBackend::acquire) and friends) is the primitive;
/// [`try_lock`](DistributedLockBackend::try_lock) and
/// [`lock`](DistributedLockBackend::lock) acquire the same lease and hand back a
/// [`LockGuard`] whose task holds the token, because the guard's fields are private

/// A blocking [`lock`](DistributedLockBackend::lock) subscribes to a `watch` on the
/// key and retries on each event until it acquires or the timeout elapses. It also
/// wakes itself at the incumbent's `deadline`: a lease lapsing writes nothing, so
/// unlike physical TTL expiry it produces no watch event (see
