//! The four gRPC services over a **real** tonic server and a real channel
//! (item `S1`, DESIGN.md).
//!
//! The unit tests beside each service call the generated `*_server` trait
//! directly, which covers the handlers' logic and nothing about the transport.
//! This file covers what only a socket can show: that all four services are
//! actually routed and served, that the credential travels the way §4.6 says it
//! does, and — the one `S1` exit criterion that cannot be asserted any other way —
//! that a **watch stream carries no RPC timeout**.
//!
//! The standalone plugin backs it, to stay hermetic (§7.6).

/// reproduce at the tonic 0.14 layer, and the test above is what establishes it:
/// a stream opened on a channel carrying `.timeout(RPC_TIMEOUT)`, and a stream
/// opened with `Request::set_timeout(RPC_TIMEOUT)`, both stay open and both
/// deliver an event long after the deadline elapses.
///
/// The reason is that a deadline governs the *response future* — which resolves
/// once the response headers arrive — and not the body that follows it, and tonic's
/// server does not enforce the `grpc-timeout` header on a streaming response
/// either. So the rule stands as a rule (a watch must not carry an RPC timeout, and
/// item `K2` must not set one), but it is not load-bearing against tonic today, and
/// a test asserting the *severing* would assert a behaviour that does not exist.

/// server imposes no deadline of its own.** If a timeout layer were ever added in
/// front of these services, all three cases above fail.
