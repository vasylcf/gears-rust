//! `D1`: the `cluster-oop` binary, spawned as a process and asked the questions the
//! exit criteria ask (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! `tests/oop_probe_ordering.rs` covers the *ordering* property in-process, where a
//! gate gear can hold the start phase open and the cancellation token is an
//! argument. This file covers what only a real process can: that `cluster-oop
//! --config <file>` - clap, `#[tokio::main]`, `registered_gears.rs`'s linkage, YAML
//! loading, logging init, the eager `DirectoryService` connect and
//! `build_oop_serve_options` - comes up and serves `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/health`
//! and `/openapi.json`, then drains on SIGTERM.
//!
//! The binary is located through `CARGO_BIN_EXE_cluster-oop`, so cargo builds it
//! before this target runs and the path can never be a stale artefact.
//!
//! **A `DirectoryService` is mandatory, and that is the framework's constraint, not
//! a fixture convenience**: `run_oop_with_options` calls
//! `DirectoryGrpcClient::connect(...).await?` and propagates the failure
//! (`bootstrap/oop.rs:551-553`), so no `OoP` gear starts without a directory. That is
//! open ask `A2`, and it is why this test serves a stub one on an ephemeral port
//! rather than pointing the child at the default `127.0.0.1:50051`.
//!
//! **What this file deliberately does not do** is add a consumer, resolve a facade
//! across the socket, or assert cluster DNS naming - that is `D4`, gated on `D2`.
