//! The three remote backend handles against a **real** cluster gear
//! (DESIGN.md).
//!
//! This file lives in the gear crate rather than beside the backends themselves,
//! and it has to: only this crate can serve the four services, because the
//! service impls are the gear's. What it buys is the assertion that matters most
//! for the whole deployable model — **the same trait, the same behaviour, both
//! sides of a socket**. Every test here drives an `Arc<dyn _Backend>` obtained
//! from a `RemoteClusterClient`, which is exactly what a consumer's `resolve()`
//! hands it, and several of them assert the remote answer against the *local*
//! backend's answer for the same operation.
//!
//! # Two halves
//!
//! The first half is the operations themselves: cache, lock and leader election
//! round-tripping over the wire, and the descriptor that makes the synchronous
//! accessors answer like the backend behind them.
//!
//! The second half — from "Elections when the connection carrying them goes
//! away" — is the property that only shows up once a connection can die under a
//! live election. A `LeaderWatch` carries two independent paths: the
//! *subscription*, which conveys whether events are flowing, and the *renewal
//! task*, which conveys whether the claim is still valid. ADR-003 requires them
//! kept apart — *"A `Closed(ConnectionLost)` on a `LeaderWatch` is a subscription
//! event. State validity is determined by the renewal-task path"* — and §6.6
//! prices it: *"losing it costs a re-subscribe, not a leadership change"*. So a
//! rolling restart, replica kill, LB drain or GOAWAY must cost a re-subscribe and
//! nothing more. Those tests drive that through a [`CuttableRelay`], and they run
//! on a multi-threaded runtime on purpose: on the single-threaded default the
//! contender's poll loop and the pump under test share one thread, and starving
//! the pump would fail them for a reason unrelated to what they assert. Each
//! timing assertion is sized so both the holding and the failing margin are
//! comfortable; the per-test comments give both.
//!
//! The standalone plugin backs the server, to stay hermetic (§7.6).
