/// End-to-end transcript: publish three events → create group → JOIN → SEEK
/// earliest → stream the three events in strict offset order → ack via SEEK →
/// re-JOIN on the same group resumes past the ack (no redelivery).
///
/// The reference fixes RF=100 so offsets are 100/101/102; the in-process mock
/// has no retention floor (offsets start at 0), so this asserts the *shape* of
/// the journey - three in-order events, an advancing group cursor, and a
/// re-JOIN that resumes from the committed cursor - rather than the literal
/// 100-based offsets.
