// Created: 2026-08-07 by Constructor Tech
//! Metric port for the write paths, and the vocabulary its attributes use.
//!
//! Declared here and implemented in `infra::metrics` so the domain names what
//! it wants measured without depending on OpenTelemetry.
//!
//! ## What this covers, and what it does not
//!
//! The concurrent-write analysis asks for a measurement layer before any
//! further tuning, and separates two questions that raw query throughput
//! conflates: how much work commits, and how much work is done and thrown
//! away. This port answers the first from where the gear can see it -- an
//! operation's wall time, the size of the subtree it touched, the closure
//! rows it wrote.
//!
//! The second needs the retry loop's own counters (attempts, serialization
//! failures, exhausted budgets), and that loop lives in `toolkit-db`, which
//! carries no instruments at all today. Adding them there is a platform
//! change touching every gear and belongs in its own review, not smuggled
//! into a resource-group PR.
