What a systematic audit of this gear's database behavior found, how it was
found, and how to repeat it on another module. The detection tooling is meant
to be reused — this gear is the worked example, not the point.

## Scope of this branch

Two terms recur in the Status column below and are worth fixing before they
are used: **this branch** is `perf/db-tx-isolation` (PR #4613); **the source
branch** is the wider audit branch this one was carved out of, the one that
still carries the tenant scoping, the authorization gates and the wider
error-mapping changes that the "What still stays out" paragraph below lists
as out of scope here.

This report is the full audit. The branch carrying it started as the
**query-count** subset — the N+1 and redundant-I/O findings — and has since
taken the transaction-boundary, retry and isolation findings that are about
*performance*: RG-02, RG-03, RG-09 and RG-15, plus the isolation decisions
they unblock. It later took RG-01 as well: the "one tenant per resource"
check and the membership insert it gates needed one transaction and one
isolation level to be correct, which is the same subject as the isolation
decisions above, so leaving it for a different branch stopped making sense.

What still stays out is tenant scoping, the authorization gates, and the
wider error-mapping changes. Two error classifications did come along, but
only where a constraint was already enforcing the invariant and what was
missing was the translation — the duplicate type code and the in-use type —
because an isolation level was standing in for it.

The Status column says which is which, and the audit suite carries only the
tests that exercise what is here: a test asserting a fix that is absent would
be noise, not coverage, so those tests stay with the branch that carries their
fixes.

## What was found

**Most of it is the N+1 query problem.** That is worth stating plainly rather
than dressing up: 6 of the 15 findings are textbook N+1 — a loop issuing one
statement per row where one statement would do — and 3 more are the same family
of avoidable round trips (a write followed by a re-read of the row just
written, or the same lookup performed twice). Nine of fifteen findings are
"this code talks to the database more times than it needs to". The remaining
six are transaction-boundary and error-handling mistakes.

This is the oldest mistake in ORM code, and it was generated at scale: the
per-row loops are individually reasonable-looking and only become a problem
multiplied by subtree size. `move` on a 10 000-node subtree under a
depth-10 parent issued roughly 100 000 separate `INSERT`s.

| ID | Class | Severity | Where | Status |
|----|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| RG-01 | no-tx-write | **Critical** | `membership_service.rs` `add_membership_inner` — check-then-insert on a bare connection; the PK includes `group_id`, so two concurrent first-memberships in different tenants both commit and the "one tenant per resource" invariant breaks | Fixed. The tenant check (`has_membership_in_other_tenant`, an existence read with `LIMIT 1`) and the membership insert now share one `SERIALIZABLE` transaction via `transaction_with_retry`. The check reads a predicate the insert writes into: apart, or together below that level, both writers see no conflict and both commit; at `SERIALIZABLE` that is the write skew SSI cancels, and the retry re-runs the loser into the rejection. Guarded by `trace_add_membership` and, on real PostgreSQL, by `forced_overlap_at_serializable_keeps_one_tenant` with `forced_overlap_at_read_committed_splits_the_resource` as its negative control |
| RG-02 | no-tx-write | Medium | `type_service.rs` `delete_type` — resolve/count/delete outside any transaction | Fixed. One transaction with bounded retry, at the backend default: `ON DELETE RESTRICT` is what makes a type in use undeletable, and `delete_by_id` maps that constraint to the same conflict the count reports. Guarded by `trace_delete_type` |
| RG-03 | no-retry-serializable | **Critical** | `type_service.rs` `create_type`/`update_type` — `SERIALIZABLE` without retry, so a `40001` reaches the caller raw. Live call sites: account-management's gear-init type registration, i.e. a startup path, not latent code | Fixed. Both moved to `transaction_with_retry`, each attempt on its own clones. Guarded by a Section 4 rule |
| RG-04 | n-plus-one | High | `group_repo.rs` `rebuild_subtree_closure` — one `INSERT` per closure row, `A×N` of them | Fixed |
| RG-05 | n-plus-one | Medium | `group_service.rs` `move_group_internal_impl` — `is_descendant` + `get_relative_depth` per descendant; both answers were already in the rows loaded a moment earlier | Fixed |
| RG-06 | n-plus-one | Medium-High | `group_repo.rs` `insert_ancestor_closure_rows` — one `INSERT` per ancestor | Fixed |
| RG-07 | n-plus-one | Low-Medium | `type_repo.rs` — junction rows inserted one per allowed parent/membership type | Fixed |
| RG-08 | redundant-io | Low-Medium | `group_repo.rs`/`type_repo.rs`/`membership_repo.rs` — insert discards the model it just got back, then re-reads the row by id | Fixed in all three, both halves. Inserts return what they wrote or assemble it from the values they were given; the `update_many` + re-read shape is gone too — `group_repo::update` returns `rows_affected`, and `type_repo::update_type` assembles the updated row inside the repository from the values it wrote, so the column set the UPDATE touches lives in one place. `find_by_code_with_model` hands back the row itself, not just its id, so the update path has the immutable `created_at` without a second read |
| RG-09 | external-call-in-tx | High | `group_service.rs` — a cross-gear `types_registry` call plus JSON-Schema compilation inside a `SERIALIZABLE` transaction, repeated on every retry | Fixed. Both entry points validate before `BEGIN`; the transaction-inner functions no longer take a `TypesRegistryClient`, so the call cannot return by accident. Guarded by a Section 4 rule |
| RG-10 | n-plus-one | High | `group_service.rs` `force_delete_subtree` — ~4 statements per node | Fixed |
| RG-11 | redundant-io | Low | `group_service.rs` — the same type resolved twice per create/update (`resolve_id` then `find_by_code`) | Fixed |
| RG-12 | n-plus-one | Medium | `type_repo.rs` `list_types` — junction reads per row, so a page of N types costs `2N+1` queries. **Read path** — the only finding not on a write path | Fixed |
| RG-13 | redundant-io | Low | `type_service.rs` — the duplicate-check loads full junction data just to test existence | Fixed |
| RG-14 | no-tx-write | Medium | `membership_service.rs` `remove_membership` — same check-then-write shape as RG-01 | Not applicable in this design. With tenant ownership derived from the membership rows themselves there is no second piece of state for a removal to keep in step: it deletes one row by its composite primary key and decides nothing from a read, so it needs neither its own transaction nor a level above the backend default. A concurrent `add_membership` either sees the row from inside its own `SERIALIZABLE` read and rejects, or does not and is the resource's first membership again — both outcomes correct. Pinned by `trace_remove_membership`, which asserts it does *not* open `SERIALIZABLE` |
| RG-15 | error-shape-swallowing | **Critical** | Platform-wide: repositories map every `sea_orm::DbErr` through `.to_string()` into `DbErr::Custom`, and `is_retryable_contention` only recognized `Exec`/`Query`. `transaction_with_retry` could therefore never tell a serialization failure was retryable when it surfaced inside a repository call — the retry loop was dead code on every write path in the gear | Fixed. `is_retryable_contention` matches `DbErr::Custom` on the same message patterns, with five regression tests. Without it the jittered backoff added alongside these fixes would never have fired |

RG-11 through RG-15 were **not** in the original problem statement — the
detector found them. RG-15 is the one worth remembering: it was found by a
*negative control*, a test written to confirm that a correctly-retried path
behaves correctly. It did not.

### Findings added after this report

The table above is the first pass. A second N+1 pass and the tenant-scope
work added two findings that code comments reference by letter rather than by
`RG-NN`, so a reader arriving from the code will not find them above:

| ID | Kind | Where | Status |
|----|------|-------|--------|
| (a) | redundant-io | `group_repo.rs` `find_model_by_id_scoped` — the membership tenant gate needed a scoped single-row read; reusing the unscoped `find_model_by_id` plus a separate scope check would have cost an extra statement per call (`repo.rs`, `membership_service.rs`) | Fixed on the source branch; not in this one — it serves the membership tenant gate |
| (b) | n-plus-one | `type_repo.rs` — one `resolve_id` per value while resolving a type filter, and one violation lookup per candidate parent in the hierarchy safety check (slope 2.0) | Fixed: `collect_type_filter_paths` + a single `WHERE schema_id IN (...)`, and `find_groups_violating_removed_parents` |

| (c) | n-plus-one | `group_service.rs` `classify_children_for_delete` — the non-force delete rejection resolved each blocking child's type path with its own `SELECT`, memoized per `gts_type_id`, so the cost grew with the number of *distinct* child types. Landed after this report, in the unfinished `name blocking children on delete` commit | Fixed on the source branch; not in this one — the code it fixes arrived with an unrelated feature |

Either give these `RG-16`/`RG-17` numbers or keep this table; what must not happen
is a code comment pointing at an audit that does not mention the finding.

Finding (c) is worth reading as a statement about the method rather than about
the code. The detector did not miss it — nothing was watching. Of the ten scale
tests, none covered `delete_group(force = false)`: the nine written during the
audit covered create, move, force delete, the two `$filter` paths and the type
operations, and the rejection path had no operation-level test at all. A defect
introduced there afterwards was invisible by construction. The tenth test now
exists and was validated the same way as the rest — the loop was restored, the
test went from 17 statements at N=12 against 7 at N=2 to a clean failure, and
the batch version brought both back to equal.

### Known and not fixed: `IN (...)` lists bounded only by a column's domain

Every list-valued predicate whose length follows the *data* or the *request*
is now chunked against `max_bind_params_for`. Two are chunked against nothing,
and are recorded here rather than fixed:

- `group_repo.rs` `resolve_type_paths_batch` and `type_repo.rs`
  `load_full_types_batch` bind one parameter per distinct GTS type id. The
  column is `SMALLINT`, so the list cannot exceed 32 767 — which is above the
  30 000 `max_bind_params_for` allows on SQLite and below the 60 000 it allows
  on PostgreSQL.

Those two numbers are `toolkit-db`'s, not the databases'. SQLite's own limit
is 32 766 host parameters and PostgreSQL's is 65 535; `max_bind_params_for`
returns a deliberately rounder, lower figure so that a caller chunking against
it has room for the predicates it did not count. Read every "ceiling" in this
document as that budget rather than as the backend's hard limit.

Reaching it needs more than 30 000 distinct types registered in one
deployment, at which point the failure is a driver error on a read path, not
data loss. The fix is the same three lines used everywhere else; what makes it
not worth landing blind is that no test can reach the boundary without
building 30 000 rows. If the type count ever gets within an order of magnitude
of that, chunk these two the same way.

Not on this list: `build_hierarchy_page`, which *is* bounded by the data
(subtree size) and is chunked — at half the ceiling, because the caller's
`AccessScope` compiles to predicates binding an unknown number of parameters
into the same statement.

### Transaction-behaviour findings (`TX-nn`)

A companion pass reviewed every write transaction in the gear — isolation level, retry budget,
external calls inside the transaction, and whether the declared invariant actually needs
`SERIALIZABLE`. Its conclusion was that nothing in the branch sat in the "must fix" class: no
unprotected write-skew and no cross-gear call inside a transaction remained. Three items were
"worth doing", and all three were done. They are recorded here because the code cites them.

| ID | Finding | Why `SERIALIZABLE` was not the right tool | Status |
|----|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| TX-01 | `TypeRepository::insert` did not classify `is_unique_violation()`, unlike `GroupRepository` and `MembershipRepository` | The invariant is `UNIQUE(schema_id)`, held by the schema at every isolation level. Only the *error shape* depended on `SERIALIZABLE`: without the mapping, a duplicate code surfaced as a raw database error unless an SSI abort happened to retry into a clean one. | Fixed — its own perf commit, not one of the RG-tagged fixes above |
| TX-02 | `update_group` always opened `SERIALIZABLE`, including for a pure rename | The predicates that need SSI — cycle detection, depth and width limits, closure rebuild — are reachable only when `parent_id` changes. | Fixed — its own perf commit, not one of the RG-tagged fixes above |
| TX-03 | `remove_membership_in_tx` did not need `SERIALIZABLE` | It deletes by the exact composite primary key `(group_id, gts_type_id, resource_id)` — no predicate a concurrent writer can invalidate. The commit that introduced the transaction documented the level as "for symmetry" with `add_membership`, not as a correctness requirement. | Fixed on the source branch; not in this one — isolation, not a query count. It holds in this design too: `remove_membership` deletes by the exact composite key and stays at the backend default |

These three are a layer apart from the RG findings the Scope section lists above: they come from
the companion isolation-level pass, not from the query-count detector, so a row here being
unresolved says nothing about whether this branch's own RG-02, RG-03, RG-09 or RG-15 fixes
landed — and, conversely, TX-01 and TX-02 landing does not mean this branch took on the source
branch's tenant-scoping or error-mapping work.

Bounded retry is kept on every downgraded path. Lowering the isolation level removes SSI aborts
(`40001`), not lock-ordering deadlocks (`40P01`), and `is_retryable_contention` treats both alike.

TX-02 and TX-03 are the same shape: `SERIALIZABLE` doubted and removed because the operation's
own predicate didn't need it. TX-01 is not that shape: its isolation level was never touched.
What moved there was error classification — a duplicate type code used to surface as a raw
database error whose shape `SERIALIZABLE` only incidentally influenced, and it now has an
explicit `is_unique_violation()` mapping instead.

The reverse case is RG-01, and it is worth stating alongside them so the direction of this
branch is not mistaken for "lower everything". `add_membership` keeps `SERIALIZABLE`, and not
for symmetry: its tenant check reads a predicate — "does any membership of this pair belong to
another tenant" — and its insert then writes into that same predicate. At the backend default
each of two first memberships reads from its own snapshot, neither sees the other's uncommitted
row, and both commit; the resource ends up owned by two tenants. That is textbook write skew,
the one anomaly `SERIALIZABLE` exists for, and no amount of narrowing the read replaces it.

The level is also the one thing this audit's statement-count rules cannot see (see "What this
does not cover" — isolation is exactly their blind spot): lower it and the trace is
byte-identical, and on SQLite, which serializes writes regardless, the outcome does not change
either. Two things close that gap. The recorder now captures the level a transaction was asked
to open at, and `trace_add_membership` asserts it — with `trace_remove_membership` and
`trace_delete_group_non_force` asserting the other direction, so "raise everything to
`SERIALIZABLE`" cannot satisfy it while undoing the saving this branch is about. And on real
PostgreSQL, `forced_overlap_at_serializable_keeps_one_tenant` drives the two transactions
through the exact overlap window and observes the SSI cancellation, while
`forced_overlap_at_read_committed_splits_the_resource` runs the same barrier one level lower
and observes the corruption — a permanent negative control, so the pairing cannot be relaxed
without a test failing.

The general lesson: a `SERIALIZABLE` write path guards nothing against a concurrent write that
runs at a lower isolation level, even one touching the exact rows it depends on. Which side of
an invariant needs which level has to be reasoned through per read/write pair — it is not a
property either side can hold on its own, and no amount of statement-count testing will surface
getting it wrong.

Two further observations from that pass, neither acted on:

- `check_hierarchy_safety` inside `update_type_in_tx` loops over the removed allowed-parent types
  with three queries per iteration. It scales with the size of the *request*, not of the database,
  so it is not in the N+1 class above — but a very long list holds a `SERIALIZABLE` transaction open
  proportionally longer. Low risk in practice: type definitions are administered by hand.
- `11_database_patterns.md` documents transactions exclusively through
  `SecureConn::in_transaction_mapped`, which has neither retry nor a configurable isolation level.
  The `Db` / `TxConfig::serializable()` / `transaction_with_retry` path this gear uses — and so do
  `ledger` and `account-management` — is absent from the guide, which therefore misleads anyone
  writing a new gear against it. This is a gap in the guide, not a deviation by the gear.

## How it was found

Three mechanisms, all deterministic and CI-runnable:

- **SQL trace capture.** A `QueryRecorder` attached through SeaORM's metric
  callback records every statement with its kind, table and parameter count.
  It is attached via a `test-support`-gated toolkit-db constructor, because
  `DBProvider` deliberately does not hand out the raw connection.
- **Transaction membership.** Read from toolkit-db's task-local guard, not by
  parsing SQL: `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` never reach the metric callback,
  since SeaORM issues them straight through sqlx's `TransactionManager`. Gives
  `writes_outside_tx()`, which is what catches `no-tx-write`.
- **Scale invariance.** Run an operation at small and large N and compare the
  *slope*, not the offset: statement count must not grow with N. This is what
  makes N+1 detection mechanical rather than a matter of noticing a loop.
- **Static source scans** for the classes that leave no SQL trace. Text
  heuristics, explicitly interim until a dylint late lint replaces them.
  Section 4 of the audit suite carries four rules here: retry on every
  transaction in both service files (RG-03 is fixed in this branch, so both
  scans are negative controls), the external call kept out of the transaction
  (RG-09), and the row lock the non-force delete takes in place of
  `SERIALIZABLE` — scoped to the function bodies they are about, because a
  whole-file scan passes on someone else's code.
- **Real PostgreSQL races** (`pg_concurrency_test.rs`, on this branch — the
  other three `testcontainers` suites are not; see the deviation section
  below). Barrier-synchronized task pairs on `testcontainers`, each ending in
  a post-state invariant check against the tables — closure agrees with
  `parent_id`, depths are right, no cycles, one tenant per resource. Checking
  the two callers' return values is not enough: both can return 200 while the
  closure table is corrupt.

Validation, so the detector's output means something: all 10 previously known
defects were rediscovered by general, class-based rules (no rule keyed to a
file or line); every class was additionally confirmed by injecting a synthetic
defect, watching the rule fire, and reverting; negative controls check that
read paths produce no write statements and that SSI-protected invariants are
not flagged.

Empirically SSI does hold where the design assumed it would: mutual `move`
(A→B against B→A) left the closure table intact across 21 runs with the loser
getting a clean `CycleDetected`, and force-delete races produced no orphans in
60+ runs.

## Deviation from the unit/E2E testing guide

**Partly in this branch, updated 2026-08-21.** The audit's full apparatus
includes four Rust `testcontainers` suites against real PostgreSQL —
`pg_concurrency_test.rs` (this gear, on this branch since `0c7341d2f`, and
extended further by the RG-01 fix above),
`pg_membership_filter_test.rs`, `pg_group_filter_test.rs` (this gear) and
`secure_group_scope_postgres.rs` (`libs/toolkit-db`) — each a deliberate,
written-down deviation from the testing guide:
[`12_unit_testing.md`](../../../../docs/toolkit_unified_system/12_unit_testing.md)
routes PostgreSQL-specific behavior to E2E, and
[`13_e2e_testing.md`](../../../../docs/toolkit_unified_system/13_e2e_testing.md)
defines E2E as pytest against a running `cf-gears-server`. None of the four
are that: they call repository/service code directly, in-process, no HTTP.
Their justification — a real dialect rejection such as
"operator does not exist: uuid = text" surfaces in the failure message,
where a pytest test would only ever see the resulting 500 — is now part of
the guide itself; see "Check which venue you actually have" in
`13_e2e_testing.md`.

`pg_concurrency_test.rs` and the `test-rg-pg` Makefile target that runs it
are on this branch. The other three suites — `pg_membership_filter_test.rs`,
`pg_group_filter_test.rs`, `secure_group_scope_postgres.rs` — live on the
branch that carries the tenant-scope fixes they exercise. This branch also
carries the SQLite-backed statement-count suites (`db_behavior_audit_test.rs`,
`query_recorder_test.rs`), which run in the default `cargo nextest` pass and
need no Docker and no feature flag; `pg_concurrency_test.rs` needs both
(`--features integration`, a Docker daemon).

## Running this audit on another module

The point of the exercise. Nothing needs copying: the recorder lives in
`toolkit_db::test_support` behind the `test-support` feature. Method:
[`16_defect_class_to_control_map.md`](../../../../docs/toolkit_unified_system/16_defect_class_to_control_map.md).

1. Add `toolkit-db` with the `test-support` feature to the gear's
   dev-dependencies and use `toolkit_db::test_support::{QueryRecorder,
   connect_with_recorder, snapshot_trace}`. The gear supplies only its own
   migrations and service wiring.
2. Write one trace test per write operation. Dump the trace
   (`DB_AUDIT_TRACE_DIR=… cargo nextest run …`) and read it once — most findings
   are visible on that first read, before any rule fires.
3. Assert `rec.writes_outside_tx().is_empty()` on every write operation.
4. Add a scale test per operation whose cost could depend on input size:
   build N=small and N=large, assert the statement count does not grow.
5. Add `rec.redundant_reads_after_write()` where writes are followed by reads.
6. Add a PostgreSQL suite behind the `integration` feature for anything whose
   correctness depends on concurrency, with a post-state invariant helper
   called from every scenario.
7. Pin each known defect as an executable assertion, so that fixing it breaks
   the pin and the fix cannot land silently. `#[ignore = "known defect …"]`
   works when the defect is observable as a statement count. When it is not —
   `SERIALIZABLE` without retry is the case here — assert the count that *is*
   there rather than the count that ought to be, and say in the doc comment
   what to change when the fix lands. See
   `static_rule_pins_type_service_serializable_without_retry`.

## What this does not cover

- **Cost of one statement.** Scale invariance proves the query's shape doesn't
  multiply; it says nothing about a single statement with a 10 000-item `IN`
  list. Parameter counts are recorded but that is a count, not a cost model.
- **Transaction duration.** Everything here counts statements. An
  in-transaction call to another gear contributes zero statements while
  plausibly dominating the transaction's wall-clock length.
- **Isolation level — was a blind spot, now closed.** `SET TRANSACTION
  ISOLATION LEVEL` bypasses the metric callback, so the recorder could not tell
  `SERIALIZABLE` from `READ COMMITTED`, and downgrading a write path passed
  every rule here. That was exercised twice. First after the audit: two write
  paths were lowered to the backend default, and an independent review later
  found a lost-update race between the group update and the group move that
  these rules could not have caught. Then again by RG-01, whose whole
  correctness rests on `add_membership` opening `SERIALIZABLE` — and lowering
  it leaves the trace byte-identical, and the SQLite outcome unchanged.
  The recorder now carries the level each transaction was *asked* to open at,
  read from the same task-local that carries the transaction id, so
  `all_in_serializable_transaction` can assert it. What that pins is the
  caller's choice, not the engine's behaviour: `SQLite` is serializable
  whatever it is told, so asking the engine would be vacuous here, while the
  thing under review is which level the service picked. Concurrency behaviour
  under that level still belongs to the concurrency suite — and that suite only
  covers the pairs it enumerates, so a new write path still needs a new pair.
- **Predicate correctness.** The trace shows a `WHERE tenant_id = ?` is
  present, not that the bound value is the right one. That is the AccessScope
  suite's job.
- **Constraint inventory**, `EXPLAIN`/index usage, lock-ordering deadlocks
  (`40P01` as opposed to `40001`), pool starvation under load, and migration
  drift on an existing schema — none are examined.
- **The `in_tx` probe's boundary** is `tokio::spawn`: task-locals don't cross
  it. A detached spawn that outlives the test's assertions is a genuine blind
  spot. This gear has no `spawn` in `src/`.

## Deferred

- **`TxRunner` marker and a dylint lint series** — the compile-time and
  lint-time layers that would prevent reintroduction. The static rules here are
  text heuristics standing in for them.
(RG-08's `update` re-read was listed here on the grounds that removing the
follow-up read meant restructuring the write to a read-then-`ActiveModel::update`
shape, trading one read for another. That was wrong about the callers: both
already held the row and both discarded what `update` returned, then read a
third time to build the response. No trade was needed — see the table above.)
- **Two contract questions**, both pinned as executable `#[ignore]`d tests rather
  than silently accepted. They were written as drifts against DESIGN.md; since
  then DESIGN.md has been corrected to describe what the code actually does, so
  what remains is the open question of what the contract *should* be: whether an
  exhausted retry deserves a dedicated status (the code returns 500 through
  `Internal`, and there is no `ServiceUnavailable` variant to return), and
  whether a transaction timeout should exist at all (`TxConfig` has no
  mechanism). The first is entangled with a wider question — the platform guide
  requires fail-closed 403 for an unreachable PDP, DESIGN said 503, the code
  returns 500 — so it belongs to an error-taxonomy pass, not to this one.
- **Statement/lock timeouts, single-snapshot hierarchy reads, `EXPLAIN`
  verification** — identified, not addressed in this pass. Backoff was on this
  list and has since been implemented: jittered exponential, base 2 ms, factor
  5, capped at 100 ms, in `toolkit-db`'s retry helper. The immediate-retry loop
  it replaced turned contention into a thundering herd.
