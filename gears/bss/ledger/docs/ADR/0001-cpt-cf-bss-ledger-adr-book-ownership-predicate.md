**ID**: `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-adr-book-ownership-predicate`

## Context and Problem Statement

Several ledger-wide anchors hang off "the owning `tenant_id`": it is the tenant-isolation/owner axis, the `export_target` holder, the period-close unit, and the functional-currency carrier. VHP tenants are **typed** (`tenant_type` on the platform `TenantInfo` — e.g. `platform`, `partner`, `organization`) and sit in one tenant tree that serves two different commercial roles: entities that **sell** (and must keep AR / Revenue / Contract-liability books, close periods, and export to an ERP) and entities that only **buy** (and appear on ledger lines as payers or resources). Which tenants own billing books, and how does the ledger decide?

## Decision Drivers

* The book owner must be an entity that legally sells — books, period close, `export_target`, and functional currency are properties of a selling legal entity, not of every tenant
* The buyer axis and the seller axis run over the *same* tenant tree and must not be conflated — payer resolution / AR consolidation is a different hierarchy walk than book-ownership / subtree reads
* The `tenant ↔ commercial-account ↔ legal-entity` mapping is not ledger domain — AMS / Catalog / billing-setup own it
* The seller predicate should be resolvable from platform-owned data (`tenant_type`, AMS/GTS catalogue), not duplicated ledger config
* Adding or retiring a selling tenant type should not require a ledger change
* The mechanism must be grounded in the actual platform catalogue (what tenant types and extension points really exist), not an invented abstraction

## Considered Options

* Any tenant owns books (untyped owner — every tenant gets books, close, `export_target`)
* Hardcoded seller type list in the ledger (`tenant_type IN ('platform','partner')` baked into ledger code)
* New seller/buyer enum added to the tenant-type model
* Trait-driven predicate owned by the AMS catalogue — `x-gts-traits.owns_billing_books` on selling tenant-type schemas (chosen)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Trait-driven predicate owned by the AMS catalogue" (decision **S7-F3**, ratified in the 2026-06-17 reconciliation-export design review; hardening verified against the platform catalogue), because it grounds the seller predicate in platform-owned typed data, keeps the ledger free of tenant-taxonomy knowledge, and makes seller-set changes an AMS catalogue change rather than a ledger release.

The normative decision (ledger-wide, stated in [`01-repository-foundation.md`](../design/01-repository-foundation.md) § Additional context):

* **Only selling entities own billing books** (AR / Revenue / Contract liability) and therefore have an **`export_target` + period close + functional currency**. The ledger-owner `tenant_id` — the isolation/owner axis, the `export_target` holder, the period-close unit, and the functional-currency carrier — **is a selling legal-entity / commercial-account**.
* **Buyer-type tenants own no books** — they appear **only** as `payer` / `resource` on journal lines; no books, no close, no `export_target`.
* The predicate "this tenant owns books" resolves from **`tenant_type` (AMS/GTS)** + the **commercial-account mapping**.
* **Two distinct hierarchies — do NOT conflate:** the **buyer hierarchy** (org → department) drives **payer resolution / AR consolidation**; the **seller hierarchy** (platform → partner → reseller) is the **book-ownership / subtree-read** axis. Different axes on the same tenant tree.
* The `tenant ↔ commercial-account ↔ legal-entity` mapping (**1:1 or 1:N**) is owned by **AMS / Catalog / billing-setup, not the ledger**; the one-functional-currency-per-legal-entity rule (FX F5) hangs off it.
* **Hardening (verified against the platform catalogue).** The tenant-type catalogue (`vhp-core-am/config/tenant-types.yaml`; GTS ids `gts.cf.core.am.tenant_type.v1~vz.ams.tenants.<type>.v1~`) defines **`platform`, `partner`, `organization`** (hierarchy via `x-gts-traits.allowed_parent_types`: platform → partner → organization); there is no `individual` type yet, and no `seller`/`buyer` enum exists — none is needed, since tenant types already carry custom `x-gts-traits`.
* **Predicate (proposed):** book-owning **seller** = `platform` + `partner`; **buyer** = `organization` (+ a future `individual`).
* **Recommended mechanism:** AMS adds an **`x-gts-traits.owns_billing_books: true`** trait to the `platform` and `partner` type schemas; the ledger's provisioning gate and the owner predicate read **that trait**, not a hardcoded type list.
* ⏳ **Pending (AMS):** confirm platform + partner are the intended sellers (and whether an `organization`/reseller can ever sell), then add the trait to the catalogue. The predicate decision itself is ratified; this hardening item is the open remainder.

### Consequences

* The ledger's seller-provisioning gate (Foundation §4.12, `POST /v1/ledger/legal-entities/{id}/provisioning`) must evaluate the ownership predicate before seeding a legal entity's reference rows (chart of accounts, currency scales, fiscal calendar + initial period) — provisioning is seller-only and must precede the first post
* Buyer-type tenants are never provisioned with books: no chart of accounts, no fiscal periods, no `export_target`, no functional currency — attempts must be rejected by the predicate gate
* Payer resolution / AR consolidation (buyer axis) and book-ownership / subtree reads (seller axis) must be implemented as separate hierarchy walks over the same tenant tree; neither may reuse the other's semantics
* The ledger reads `tenant_type` / the `owns_billing_books` trait from AMS/GTS and the commercial-account mapping from AMS — it stores no tenant taxonomy of its own; adding or retiring a selling type is an AMS catalogue change, not a ledger change
* Until AMS lands the trait, the predicate is evaluated against the proposed seller set (`platform` + `partner`); the ledger must switch to reading the trait once it exists ⏳
* Functional currency is bound per selling legal entity (via the AMS mapping), so the FX layer's one-functional-currency-per-legal-entity rule is anchored to this predicate

### Confirmation

* Design review: the provisioning gate and every book-anchored surface (`export_target`, period close, functional currency) key off the seller predicate; no code path grants books to a buyer-type tenant
* Integration test: provisioning a `platform`/`partner` (seller) legal entity succeeds; provisioning an `organization` (buyer) tenant is rejected by the predicate gate
* Code review: the predicate reads `tenant_type` / `x-gts-traits.owns_billing_books` from AMS/GTS; no hardcoded tenant-type taxonomy lives in ledger domain logic once the trait ships
* Cross-team checkpoint: AMS sign-off recorded and the `owns_billing_books` trait present in the tenant-type catalogue (closes the ⏳ item)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Any tenant owns books (untyped owner)

Every tenant gets ledger books, a fiscal calendar, an `export_target`, and a functional currency.

* Good, because no predicate to design — provisioning is uniform
* Bad, because it is semantically wrong: books, close, and ERP export are properties of a selling legal entity; a buying department has no legal-entity standing, no ERP, no functional currency of its own
* Bad, because it multiplies close/export machinery across tenants that will never post revenue, and every buyer would need placeholder configuration
* Bad, because it conflates the buyer and seller hierarchies, poisoning both payer resolution and subtree-read semantics

### Hardcoded seller type list in the ledger

The ledger bakes `tenant_type IN ('platform','partner')` into its provisioning gate and owner predicate.

* Good, because trivially simple and immediately implementable — no cross-team dependency
* Good, because it matches the currently verified catalogue (only three types exist)
* Bad, because tenant taxonomy leaks into ledger code — adding/retiring a selling type (e.g. a selling reseller) becomes a ledger release
* Bad, because the ledger asserts a business fact (who sells) that AMS owns
* Bad, because divergence risk: AMS evolves the type catalogue, the ledger's list silently goes stale

### New seller/buyer enum on the tenant type

Extend the AMS tenant-type model with an explicit `seller`/`buyer` classification enum.

* Good, because the classification would be explicit, platform-owned data
* Bad, because verified against the catalogue: **no such enum exists anywhere**, so it is a new modeling concept requiring AMS schema evolution
* Bad, because it is unnecessary — the tenant-type substrate already carries arbitrary custom `x-gts-traits` (`allowed_parent_types`, `idp_provisioning`, and traits exercised by RMS test scenarios), which express exactly this kind of capability flag
* Bad, because a binary enum is less extensible than traits if further billing capabilities need flagging later

### Trait-driven predicate owned by the AMS catalogue (chosen)

AMS adds `x-gts-traits.owns_billing_books: true` to the `platform` and `partner` tenant-type schemas; the ledger's provisioning gate and owner predicate read the trait.

* Good, because the seller set is AMS catalogue data — adding/retiring a selling type is a catalogue change, not a ledger change
* Good, because it uses an existing, verified extension mechanism (`x-gts-traits`), not a new modeling concept
* Good, because the ledger stays taxonomy-free: it evaluates one boolean trait plus the AMS-owned commercial-account mapping
* Good, because the mechanism was verified against the actual platform catalogue (`vhp-core-am/config/tenant-types.yaml`) rather than assumed
* Neutral, because until the trait lands the ledger evaluates the proposed set (`platform` + `partner`) as an interim
* Bad, because it introduces a cross-team dependency — AMS must confirm the seller set and land the catalogue change (⏳ pending)
* Bad, because a misconfigured trait (e.g. accidentally set on `organization`) would grant books platform-wide; catalogue governance must guard the trait

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../PRD.md)
- **DESIGN**: [01-repository-foundation.md](../design/01-repository-foundation.md)

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-fr-tenant-isolation-posting` — the isolation/owner axis is the selling entity's `tenant_id`; buyer tenants appear only as `payer`/`resource` attributes on lines within the seller's scope
* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-fr-multi-axis-attribution` — `payer` and `resource` line attribution is exactly how buyer-type tenants surface in the ledger; the buyer hierarchy drives payer resolution, not book ownership
* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-fr-accounting-periods-close` — the period-close unit is the book-owning seller; buyer tenants have no periods to close
* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-fr-multi-currency-fx` — the functional currency is carried by the selling legal entity (one functional currency per legal entity, via the AMS mapping)
* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-contract-erp-export` — `export_target` exists only on book-owning sellers; ERP export is per selling legal entity
* `cpt-cf-bss-ledger-actor-erp-gl` — the downstream ERP/GL relationship is anchored to the selling legal entity that owns the books
