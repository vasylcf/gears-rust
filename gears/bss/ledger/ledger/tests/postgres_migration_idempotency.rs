//! C1 regression: the gear's migrations run through the toolkit runner
//! (`run_migrations_for_testing`), whose per-gear bookkeeping table is created
//! *unqualified*, BEFORE our schema migration creates `bss`. The connection
//! carries a `search_path` (prod config), so the schema that the unqualified
//! bookkeeping table resolves into depends on the path ORDER:
//!
//! - `bss,public` (the original, buggy order): on boot 1 `bss` does not exist
//!   yet, so bookkeeping lands in `public`; on boot 2 `bss` exists and is first
//!   in the path, so a *second* empty bookkeeping table is created in `bss`,
//!   the history reads empty, every migration re-runs, and the non-`IF NOT
//!   EXISTS` `CREATE TABLE bss.ledger_journal_entry` aborts -> startup crash loop.
//! - `public,bss` (the fix): `public` always exists and is first, so the
//!   bookkeeping table is in `public` on every boot; the history is stable and
//!   the second boot is a clean no-op. Domain tables are `bss.`-qualified in
//!   the migrations, so runtime DML still resolves them in `bss`.
//!
//! Ignored by default (Docker/testcontainers); run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-ledger --test postgres_migration_idempotency -- --ignored`.
