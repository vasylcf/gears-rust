//! `BssPricingGear` — toolkit gear declaration and lifecycle.
//!
//! The gear is one deployable modular monolith running in two roles: a
//! synchronous authoring / publish / preview API and a read-model service, over
//! one `toolkit-db` backend. `init()` is the composition root — one flat wiring
//! sequence — and stores a [`PricingRuntime`] the REST capability and the
//! background lifecycle both read.
//!
//! Capabilities: `db` (the Foundation tables and their append-only enforcement
//! are migrations), `rest` (the authoring + read-model surfaces), `stateful`
//! (**every ticker `serve` spawns** — `crate::infra::jobs` is the roster and this
//! clause deliberately does not repeat it). Declared dependencies are the PEP and
//! the type registry: every ctx-bearing path gates through `access_scope` before
//! touching a repository, and the AuthZ label type-schemas are registered at init.
//!
//! It does not repeat the roster because a list beside a roster leaves only one of
//! the two true, and it is never the prose.
//!
//! The `stateful` entry drives independent leased tickers, each with its own key and
//! cadence (`crate::infra::jobs` states what each is for). **No ticker waits on
//! another**: the warm re-drive is what turns a publish's pending handle into a
//! version a consumer can pin — without it `pricing_read_model` stays empty whatever
//! else is built; the activation sweep is what makes a scheduled window take effect
//! at its own instant rather than at the next publish; and the gated-market
//! refresher is what keeps §7's backlog gauge from reading zero while markets are
//! gated.
//!
//! It also drives tasks that are **not** tickers and are joined by the same
//! machinery: [`Self::spawn_compensation_worker`] drains `infra::repricing`'s
//! lock-release lane, and [`Self::spawn_apply_worker`] applies the repricing runs
//! the REST surfaces accept. Neither has a cadence or a lease — each serves a queue
//! of this replica's own work, which no other process can see — and both are here
//! for the one property the tickers also have: the lifecycle owns them, cancels them
//! and joins them. The same work on a detached `Handle::spawn` costs exactly that —
//! a shutdown abandons it mid-statement.
//!
//! # The lease posture: TTL = tick, no renewal, no fence — declined deliberately
//!
//! Every ticker passes its **tick interval** as the lease TTL (5s warm, 60s window,
//! 60s gated) and every pass releases its guard at the end. Neither of
//! [`coord::LeaseGuard`]'s other two seams is used:
//! [`spawn_renewal`](coord::LeaseGuard::spawn_renewal), the heartbeat whose
//! convention is `period ≈ ttl/3` and which signals loss in band through
//! `RenewalState::Lost`; and
//! [`with_ack_in_tx`](coord::LeaseGuard::with_ack_in_tx), the write fence that turns
//! a mid-flight steal into `AckError::LeaseLost`. The sibling `bss-ledger` takes
//! both — `infra::recognition::run_service` runs a 1-minute TTL renewed every 20s,
//! `infra::period_close` a 2-minute TTL renewed every 40s.
//!
//! **The design set does not say which posture this gear owes**, so this is recorded
//! as a decision with its reasons rather than resolved. What the set does say, in
//! every place it speaks: `DESIGN.md` §3.4 and `01-foundation.md` §4 name the
//! coordination lease library as *"singleton coordination"* for this work;
//! `07-pricewindow-linkage.md` §4 and its DoD require that *"a killed-and-restarted
//! job (lease takeover) activates exactly once (idempotent)"*;
//! `12-operator-efficiency.md` §6 and D-37 make crash recovery *"lease takeover +
//! journal re-drive"* for the bulk runner. Not one of them names a TTL, a renewal
//! period, or a fence. Both readings below are consistent with all of it.
//!
//! **Reading A, which is the one built.** The set's requirement is *idempotence
//! under takeover*, and a lease whose loss is harmless needs no renewal to be
//! correct. It is harmless on each of these three paths, and the argument is per
//! path rather than shared — [`Self::spawn_warm_ticker`] and
//! [`Self::spawn_activation_ticker`] each carry their own, and the second one
//! explicitly refuses to inherit the first's. In summary: every write is guarded by a
//! key or a predicate (the delta INSERT by its primary key, the finalize by its
//! `catalog_version IS NULL` compare-and-swap, the frontier by its forward-only
//! predicate, the window flip by `state = <expected>` plus §4's boundary, both events
//! by `uq_pricing_outbox_dedup_key`), and **no pass holds durable in-progress
//! state** — there is no RUNNING row, no cursor and no "swept" column anywhere on
//! this plane, so the lease is the only in-flight state and the store's own rows are
//! the record of what has been done. A pass that loses its lease therefore finishes
//! against a store that refuses whatever a peer already did, and the next tick
//! re-drives the rest. On that reading TTL = tick is not a compromise but the point:
//! it bounds a **crashed** holder's blockage to exactly one tick, where a longer slot
//! would stall a whole deployment's sweep to protect a race that is already safe.
//!
//! **Reading B, which is why this section exists.** Where the platform offers a
//! mechanical guarantee, a hand-maintained argument is the thing that rots: reading A
//! is nine claims about nine call sites, and every future write on these paths joins
//! the list silently. The sibling takes both seams for units that are long and
//! multi-statement, and one of these passes *is* long — a warm pass issues one
//! discovery read, then two pending reads and a registry round trip per tenant, up to
//! `pending_tenants_per_pass` (250) tenants, against a **5-second** TTL. So a warm
//! pass outrunning its lease is routine rather than hypothetical, and what it costs
//! today is a `release()` that matches zero rows and coord logging *"row was likely
//! stolen before release"* at `warn` — noise attributed to a steal that did not
//! happen, plus a peer replica repeating work. Wasted, not wrong; but it is a warn an
//! operator has no action for.
//!
//! **What would settle it.** Any of these turns reading B into the required posture
//! and the argument above into a defect: a durable in-progress marker on any pass; a
//! write on these paths that is neither key- nor predicate-guarded; or a pass whose
//! partial effect is not self-healing on the next tick. Adopting the seams is also
//! not a one-line change — `spawn_renewal` is only meaningful with the TTL raised to
//! a multiple of the tick *and* the `RenewalState::Lost` signal acted on, since
//! renewal alone lowers the odds of a silent loss without making one detectable.
//! Which is exactly why it is not done speculatively.
