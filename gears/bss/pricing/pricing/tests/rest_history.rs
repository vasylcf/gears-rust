//! Router-level tests for `GET /bss-pricing/v1/history` — Slice 12's first
//! reachable surface (§5, `inst-he-read`; D-12, D-125, D-270).
//!
//! The harness is `rest_frontier`'s, deliberately: both are unauthenticated-to-
//! authorized reads driven over a flat-`In` PDP, and two harnesses would be two
//! answers to what this gear's PEP returns. **The gates are not the same pair**,
//! and this paragraph said they were until 2026-08-20: `read_history` asks
//! `audit × read` and `export_history` asks `audit × export`
//! (`api/rest/history.rs`'s own gate note, since 2026-08-14 — the trail is its own
//! disclosure, so filing it under `plan × read` handed "who changed what, when"
//! to every holder of catalog read and left `audit_read` granting nothing).
//! A stale gate name in a test doc is how the wrong permission gets re-asserted.
//!
//! **What only a router test can see here** is the pair the engine cannot: that
//! the gate runs *before* the query, so a refusal is 403 and not an empty page;
//! and that a malformed `limit` or `cursor` reaches the wire as 400 rather than
//! as a 500 from a panic in parsing.
//!
//! Driven through the real router with `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`, so the
//! extractors, the PEP gate and the response serialization are all in the path.
//! What the eight cases below drive — this list described the *frontier* route
//! until 2026-08-20, down to a `pin_eligible: false` reading and a
//! `pin_frontier_repo::advance` neither of which appears in this file:
//!
//!   (1) no authenticated `SecurityContext` ⇒ 401 — distinct from a denial,
//!       because the caller is not yet known;
//!   (2) the PDP denies ⇒ 403 `permission_denied`, not an empty page;
//!   (3) an authorized caller ⇒ 200 carrying one entry per price row with the
//!       `actor` taken from the row's own `created_by`, and `next_cursor` null
//!       when the walk is done;
//!   (4) `limit=0` and a malformed `cursor` ⇒ 400 each, named in the document;
//!   (5) the cursor the wire hands back opens the next page, and the walk is the
//!       commit order;
//!   (6) the page is filtered by the **compiled scope**, so a caller allowed
//!       only for another tenant reads none of its own rows;
//!   (7) `audit × read` alone reads and cannot export (403 on the export), which
//!       is what the second action buys;
//!   (8) the export chunk is the same walk the read serves.
//!
//! Every case runs against an in-memory `SQLite` migrated by the gear's own
//! `Migrator`, which is what makes it a test of the route and not of a mock: the
//! price rows are written through `PriceRepo` and read back across the
//! `SecureORM` tenant filter the compiled `AccessScope` binds.
