//! Postgres-only: the migration chain, executed against the backend it targets
//! and **through the runner production uses**.
//!
//! Until this suite existed the chain had never run on Postgres. Every trigger,
//! CHECK and partial index was verified by reading the statement text beside the
//! executed `SQLite` mirror — which proves the two branches say the same thing
//! and proves nothing about whether either is accepted by the server.
//!
//! # Two things this suite is careful about, both learned the hard way
//!
//! **It runs the chain the way the gear boots.** `DatabaseCapability` hands
//! `Migrator::migrations()` to the toolkit runner
//! ([`run_migrations_for_testing`] is its test entry point), which applies in
//! **name** order and books into an *unqualified* `toolkit_migrations_*` table.
//! `MigratorTrait::up` does neither — it applies in vec order and books into
//! `seaql_migrations` — so a suite built on it exercises an ordering production
//! never uses and cannot see the C1 bug class the sibling ledger found: an
//! unqualified bookkeeping table resolving into whichever schema the
//! connection's `search_path` puts first, so that boot 2 finds an empty history
//! and re-runs every migration into a crash loop.
//!
//! **It pins rosters by name, not by count.** A count is satisfied by *any* set
//! of the right size, so a constraint replaced by `CHECK (1 = 1)` keeps a count
//! green — which is exactly how fourteen `pricing_price` CHECKs once could each
//! have been neutralised with the whole suite green. Every CHECK in this chain is
//! uniquely named, so the roster was free and the count was a false economy.
//!
//! This paragraph said "any **62** objects" until 2026-08-04, and by then the
//! roster held 76. That is the small, characteristic way a count rots and a
//! roster does not: the assertion stayed correct because it names its members,
//! while the sentence explaining the assertion carried a number nobody was
//! obliged to update. The number is gone rather than corrected — the rosters
//! below are the count, and a second copy of it in prose is a second thing to
//! keep true.
//!
//! # What a Postgres suite has to do to be evidence
//!
//! **Prove a constraint by executing the statement it must refuse**, and assert
//! the error names that constraint. A test that writes only valid values catches
//! a constraint that got *narrower* and never one that stopped refusing.
//!
//! **Put the world in the state where the object under test is what answers.** A
//! refusal an earlier guard produces is not evidence about the guard named in the
//! test.
//!
//! **Every guard must be provable by removal**: delete the `CONSTRAINT` or the
//! trigger, watch *exactly one* test fail, restore, and report which test it was.
//!
//! **The rosters issue no DML and are therefore evidence of presence only.** That
//! the objects reached the server is what they say; that any of them *refuses*
//! what it claims to is Track P's, one executed refusal per object.
//!
//! The one exception is `a_key_widening_applies_over_rows_the_table_already_holds`,
//! and it is an exception about the **runner** rather than about a guard: a
//! migration that alters a key has to be applied to a table that already holds
//! rows, which is a state no boot of an empty chain reaches, so that case writes
//! rows between two staged runs. It is here and not in a schema suite because what
//! it exercises is the chain being applied in two halves.
//!
//! Ignored by default — they need Docker. Run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-pricing -- --ignored`.
