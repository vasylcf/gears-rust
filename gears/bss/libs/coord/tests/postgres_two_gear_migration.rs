//! Postgres-only: the two-gear boot the `IF NOT EXISTS` fix was written for,
//! run against the dialect the crash happened on and in the shape both real
//! consumers use.
//!
//! `up` builds **two independent SQL literals**
//! (`m0001_create_coord_leases.rs`): a schema-qualified Postgres `CREATE TABLE`
//! and a bare `SQLite` one. The in-crate tests
//! (`m0001_create_coord_leases_tests.rs`) connect `sqlite::memory:`, so they
//! exercise the `SQLite` literal only — an edit that dropped `IF NOT EXISTS` from
//! the Postgres literal alone would reproduce the exact production crash loop
//! (`bss-pricing` booting beside a long-running `bss-ledger`) with a green
//! suite.
//!
//! Two things are Postgres-only here and neither is reachable from `SQLite`:
//!
//! * `Migration::in_schema("bss")` — the constructor **both** consumers pass
//!   (`gears/bss/ledger/ledger/src/infra/storage/migrations.rs`,
//!   `gears/bss/pricing/pricing/src/infra/storage/migrations.rs`). `SQLite` has a
//!   single namespace and ignores the schema entirely, so the `SQLite` tests can
//!   only ever call `unqualified()`.
//! * The `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` that `up` issues before the table, whose
//!   own repeat-safety is likewise unasserted anywhere else.
//!
//! As with the `SQLite` twin, these call `up` **directly**, twice, rather than
//! going through `run_migrations_for_testing`: the runner's per-gear bookkeeping
//! would skip the second apply, which is precisely what does NOT happen across
//! two gears with separate bookkeeping.
//!
//! Ignored by default (Docker); run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-coord --test postgres_two_gear_migration -- --ignored`, or via
//! `make test-coord-pg`.
