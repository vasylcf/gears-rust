//! Postgres-only: does [`LeaseGuard::with_ack_in_tx`]'s fence actually reject a
//! lease that a peer stole **after** the ack transaction took its snapshot?
//!
//! This is the one scenario SQLite cannot model. SQLite serializes write
//! transactions (a single writer), so a peer steal cannot interleave "inside"
//! an open ack transaction the way it can under Postgres MVCC. The concern is
//! specific to Postgres `SERIALIZABLE`:
//!
//! * The ack transaction's snapshot is taken at its **first statement**, and
//!   the fence predicate `locked_until > NOW()` reads `NOW()` as
//!   `transaction_timestamp()` — the transaction's *start* time.
//! * If the ack transaction reads the lease row (fixing its snapshot) while the
//!   lease is still live, then outlives the TTL, a peer can steal the lease and
//!   commit. Under the ack transaction's frozen snapshot the row still looks
//!   "mine" and still looks live, so the fence SELECT can return a row.
//! * The safety of the fence then rests entirely on `SERIALIZABLE` aborting the
//!   ack transaction at COMMIT (a `40001`, which the retry helper turns into a
//!   fresh attempt that observes the steal → `LeaseLost`). Whether Postgres SSI
//!   actually raises that abort for a single read-then-commit against a
//!   concurrently-updated row is exactly what this test settles empirically.
//!
//! The test asserts the **safety property**: after a peer steals the lease
//! mid-ack, the acknowledged commit must NOT succeed — it must surface
//! [`AckError::LeaseLost`]. An `Ok(_)` outcome means the fence accepted a stolen
//! lease (the reviewed concern is real). Ignored by default; run with
//! `cargo test -p cf-gears-bss-coord --test postgres_fence -- --ignored`.
